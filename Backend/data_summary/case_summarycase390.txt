## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Plaintiff’s Argument (Siemens Gamesa Renewable Power Pvt. Ltd.):**
    * Siemens Gamesa claimed that Mytrah Energy repeatedly failed to meet its obligations under the MAA by not off-taking the agreed volume of WTGS. 
    * Siemens Gamesa had issued demand letters seeking liquidated damages and invoked the arbitration clause in the MAA due to Mytrah Energy's continued non-compliance.
    * Two independent arbitral claims were filed and the Arbitral Tribunal, composed of retired Supreme Court and High Court judges, awarded liquidated damages and interest totaling over 440 crores.
    * Siemens Gamesa argued that the award was enforceable as no stay was granted on the award by the Commercial Court during the proceedings under Section 34 of the Act.
    * They contended that Mytrah Energy might attempt to dispose of its assets to frustrate the execution of the award and sought interim relief under Section 9 of the Act to protect their interests.
    * Siemens Gamesa emphasized the need to secure information about Mytrah Energy's assets and liabilities to effectively enforce the award.
    * They also sought the return of bank guarantees submitted by Mytrah Energy as part of the MAA, arguing that holding these guarantees caused prejudice and hardship. 

* **Defendant’s Argument (Mytrah Energy India Private Limited):**
    * Mytrah Energy argued that the Commercial Court erred in granting the relief under Section 9, claiming that the remedy is only available before the arbitral award is executable. 
    * They insisted that once an award is executable, the decree holder must seek enforcement under Section 36 of the Act through the established procedures of the Code of Civil Procedure.
    * Mytrah Energy contended that the Commercial Court exceeded its jurisdiction by granting reliefs that were not directly requested by Siemens Gamesa and that the order to return the bank guarantee was an example of this.
    * They argued that Section 9 doesn't apply post-award and that the plaintiff should solely rely on the provisions of the Civil Procedure Code for enforcing the award.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The court recognized the wide scope of Section 9 of the Act, 1996, and its applicability both before, during, and after arbitral proceedings.
    * The court emphasized that Section 9 complements Section 36, providing a mechanism to protect the decree holder's interests until the award is fully enforced.
    * The court acknowledged that the decree holder can seek interim measures under Section 9 to prevent the other party from frustrating the award's execution by disposing of assets.
    * The court found that the Commercial Court had rightly exercised its discretion in granting the interim reliefs to Siemens Gamesa, considering the lack of readily available information regarding Mytrah Energy's assets and liabilities.

* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The court interpreted Section 9 to allow for the granting of interim measures to preserve the assets, secure information, and safeguard the decree holder's rights until the award is enforced through Section 36 of the Act.
    * The court relied on various precedents, particularly the decisions of the Bombay High Court, the Madras High Court, and the Kerala High Court, to support its interpretation.
    * The court also recognized the Supreme Court's stance on Section 9 in Essar House Private Limited vs. Arcellor Mittal Nippon Steel India Limited, emphasizing the wide power granted to the courts to ensure the protection of the amount in dispute.

* **Application of Law:**
    * The court applied the principles of purposive interpretation, balance of convenience, and prima facie case to justify the grant of interim relief under Section 9.
    * The court assessed the plaintiff's apprehensions about the potential for Mytrah Energy to dispose of assets to evade execution and deemed them a genuine concern, especially given the lack of readily accessible information about their assets and liabilities.
    * The court considered the arguments and evidence presented by both parties, taking into account the precedents cited.

## 6. Judgment

* **Final Decision:** The Telangana High Court dismissed both appeals filed by Mytrah Energy India Private Limited against the orders passed by the Commercial Court in COP Nos. 19 and 18 of 2022.

* **Relief Granted:**
    * The court upheld the Commercial Court's order directing Mytrah Energy to declare all its movable and immovable assets, including those free from encumbrances.
    * The court also affirmed the order requiring Mytrah Energy to return the bank guarantees provided by Siemens Gamesa Renewable Power Pvt. Ltd.

* **Orders:**

    * The court ordered the dismissal of the appeals and closed any pending miscellaneous applications.

* **Future Relevance:** This case provides a precedent for future cases involving similar situations where a decree holder seeks to protect their interests before the award is fully enforced. 

* **Broader Context:** The judgment highlights the importance of ensuring that the fruits of an arbitral award are not rendered illusory due to the actions of the other party.
