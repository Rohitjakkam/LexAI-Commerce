## Case Title

* **Case Name:** Sri Narasu's Coffee Company Pvt. Ltd. vs. Narasu's Saarathy Enterprises Pvt. Ltd.
* **Court:** Madras High Court
* **Date of Judgment:** 24th January 2020
* **Citation:** O.S.A.No.17 & 18 of 2020

## Background and Context

* **Brief Overview:** Sri Narasu's Coffee Company Pvt. Ltd. (Appellant) filed an appeal challenging an order by the Madras High Court (Commercial Division) transferring multiple lawsuits from the Principal District Court (Commercial Division), Salem, to the Original Side of the Madras High Court. The Appellant argued that the forum conveniens (convenience of the forum) favored holding the trials in Salem, as the parties involved were located there. The Respondent, Narasu's Saarathy Enterprises Pvt. Ltd., sought to consolidate all the cases in the Madras High Court.
* **Key Issues:** The key issue in this case was the maintainability of the appeal against the order transferring the suits. The court had to determine if the transfer order constituted a "judgment" appealable under Clause 15 of the Letters Patent or an "order" appealable under Order XLIII CPC as amended by the Commercial Courts Act, 2015. 

## Legal Principles Involved

* **Relevant Statutes and Provisions:**
    * **Commercial Courts Act, 2015:** 
        * **Section 13(1A):** This provision deals with appeals against judgments or orders passed by a Commercial Court at the level of a District Judge or the Commercial Division of a High Court. It includes a proviso specifying that only orders enumerated under Order XLIII CPC or Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, are appealable.
    * **Code of Civil Procedure, 1908:**
        * **Order XLIII CPC:** This order specifies the orders against which appeals can be filed.
    * **Letters Patent of the Madras High Court:**
        * **Clause 15:** This clause deals with appeals from judgments of the High Court's original jurisdiction to the appellate jurisdiction.
* **Precedents Cited:**
    * **Kandla Export Corporation and Another Vs. OCI Corporation and another (2018) 14 SCC 715:** This case clarifies that appeals lie only from orders specifically enumerated under Order XLIII CPC as per Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act.
    * **Shah Babulal Khimji Vs. Jayaben D.Kania (1981 (4) SCC 8):** This case provides illustrations of interlocutory orders that can be treated as "judgments" under the Letters Patent. 
* **Legal Doctrines:**
    * **Forum Conveniens:** This doctrine refers to the principle of selecting the most convenient forum for a lawsuit.
    * **Judgment vs. Order:** The court differentiated between a "judgment" (a final decision resolving a dispute) and an "order" (a directive on a specific point).

## Arguments Presented

* **Appellant's Argument:** The Appellant argued that the transfer of cases to the Madras High Court was against the principle of forum conveniens, as all the parties and witnesses were located in Salem. They contended that the trial should have been conducted in Salem for convenience and efficiency. The Appellant also argued that the transfer order was not an appealable "judgment" under Clause 15 of the Letters Patent or an "order" under Order XLIII CPC as amended by the Commercial Courts Act, 2015.
* **Respondent's Argument:** The Respondent argued that the transfer order was not an appealable order. They relied on Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, and Order XLIII CPC, arguing that the transfer order did not fall under the specified category of appealable orders. They also argued that consolidating all cases in the Madras High Court would ensure consistent rulings and avoid conflicting judgments.

## Court's Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:** 
    * The court emphasized that the proviso to Section 13(1A) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, restricts appealability to specific orders enumerated under Order XLIII CPC or Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.
    * The court determined that the transfer order in this case did not fall under the purview of Order XLIII CPC.
    * The court also concluded that the transfer order did not constitute a "judgment" under Clause 15 of the Letters Patent, as it did not affect the ultimate rights or interests of the parties involved in the suit.
* **Interpretation of Law:** The court meticulously interpreted the relevant statutory provisions, including Section 13(1A) of the Commercial Courts Act and Order XLIII CPC, to determine the scope of appealability. They also referred to past judgments, including Kandla Export Corporation and Shah Babulal Khimji, to clarify the distinction between "judgments" and "orders."
* **Application of Law:** Applying the legal principles to the facts of the case, the court held that the transfer order was neither a "judgment" appealable under Clause 15 of the Letters Patent nor an "order" appealable under Order XLIII CPC as amended by the Commercial Courts Act, 2015.

## Judgment

* **Final Decision:** The appeals were dismissed as not maintainable.
* **Relief Granted:** No relief was granted as the appeals were dismissed.
* **Orders:** The court ordered that the appeals be dismissed and the connected Civil Miscellaneous Petitions be closed.

## Implications

* **Impact on Law:** The judgment reaffirms the limited scope of appealability of orders under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, as defined by Order XLIII CPC and Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. It emphasizes that transfer orders are not typically considered appealable orders. 
* **Future Relevance:** The case provides important precedent for future cases involving the appealability of transfer orders in the context of the Commercial Courts Act and the Letters Patent of the Madras High Court. It highlights the need for clear legal grounds for appealing such orders.
* **Broader Context:** The case highlights the complexities of the Commercial Courts Act and its interplay with existing legal frameworks. It underlines the importance of careful consideration of appealability issues in commercial litigation.
