## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Plaintiff's Argument:** The plaintiff, Suraj Holdings Limited, argued that the District and Sessions Judge had the power to transfer the Suit to the Commercial Court under Section 24 of the CPC. They contended that the Commercial Court, though established under the Act, is staffed by officers of the District Judiciary and is thus subordinate to the District Court. 
* **Defendant's Argument:** Namita Gupta argued that the lower courts lacked the power to transfer the Suit to a Commercial Court. She asserted that the Act provided a specific mechanism for transferring suits to Commercial Courts (Section 15), which only applies to suits pending before the constitution of Commercial Courts. She further stated that the Act, being a special statute, overrides the general provisions of the CPC, including Section 24.  Gupta also argued that the Commercial Court, being a separate hierarchy of courts under the Act, is not subordinate to the District Court. 

## 5. Courtâ€™s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The Commercial Courts Act, 2015 does not explicitly exclude the application of Section 24 of the CPC.
    * The Commercial Court, though established under the Act, does not become a court subordinate to the District Court for the purposes of Section 24 of the CPC.
    * The power to transfer suits between Commercial Courts within a district rests with the High Court, delegated to the District Judge.
    * Returning a plaint under Order VII Rule 10 of the CPC does not negate the power of the High Court to transfer the suit under Section 24 of the CPC.
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The court analyzed the scheme of the Commercial Courts Act, noting its intent to establish a distinct hierarchy of courts for commercial disputes.
    * The court interpreted Section 15 of the Act as a specific provision for transferring pending cases to Commercial Courts, not applicable to suits filed after their establishment.
    * The court determined that the Act does not explicitly amend or repeal Section 24 of the CPC, thus maintaining its applicability to commercial disputes.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The court applied the principles of statutory interpretation to conclude that the Act does not exclude the application of Section 24 of the CPC.
    * The court applied the principle of the special law overriding general law to determine that the Act, as a specific law dealing with commercial disputes, would prevail over the general provisions of the CPC.
    * The court applied the principle of hierarchy of courts to ascertain that while the Commercial Courts are staffed by officers of the District Judiciary, they are not subordinate to the District Court within the hierarchy established by the Act.

## 6. Judgment

* **Final Decision:** The court set aside the orders of the lower courts transferring the Suit to the Commercial Court.
* **Relief Granted:** The court, exercising its power under Section 24 of the CPC, transferred the Suit from the Court of the Additional District Judge to the Court of the District Judge (Commercial), South-East District, Saket District Court.
* **Orders:** The parties were directed to appear before the Transferee Court on the date already fixed. 

## 7. Implications

* **Future Relevance:** The case sets a precedent for future cases involving the transfer of suits between different types of courts under the Commercial Courts Act and the CPC. It provides clarity on the jurisdiction and power of different courts in handling commercial disputes.
* **Broader Context:** The judgment emphasizes the importance of adhering to the specific procedures and rules laid down by the Commercial Courts Act for handling commercial disputes, highlighting the specialized nature of commercial litigation.
