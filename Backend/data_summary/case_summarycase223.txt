## 2. Background and Context

This case arose from a dispute between the Executive Engineer, Water Ways Division No.1, Chakradharpur (hereinafter "Appellant") and M/S Modi Project Ltd. (hereinafter "Respondent") over a contract for the construction of the Jharjhara Reservoir Project in West Singhbhum district. The Respondent was awarded the contract on a turnkey basis, with a project value of Rs. 51,51,00,000/-. However, the project was significantly delayed due to land acquisition issues and public resistance, leading to the Respondent's claim for compensation. 

**Key Issues:**

1. Whether the Appellant breached the contract by failing to deliver hindrance-free land to the Respondent, thus preventing the Respondent from performing the project work.
2. Whether the Respondent was entitled to compensation for various expenses incurred due to the delay, including idling of survey teams, on-site and off-site establishment costs, and loss of profit.
3. Whether the Appellant's counter-claim was rightly rejected by the Arbitrator.
4. Whether the Arbitral Award was valid and could be set aside under the provisions of Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.

## 4. Arguments Presented

**Respondent’s Argument (Claimant before the Arbitrator):**

* The Appellant failed to deliver hindrance-free land at the work site, specifically for the main dam and canal systems, thus preventing the Respondent from executing the contract work.
* The Appellant repeatedly assured the Respondent that the land would be made available and urged them to keep their workforce and machinery ready.
* The Appellant's failure to deliver the land constituted a fundamental breach of contract, frustrating the Respondent's performance and leading to various losses.
* The Respondent was entitled to compensation for idling of survey teams, on-site and off-site establishment costs, and loss of profit due to the Appellant's breach.
* The Appellant's counter-claim was filed belatedly and should not have been entertained.

**Appellant’s Argument (Respondent before the Arbitrator):**

* The Respondent was aware of the land acquisition challenges and should have planned their construction work program accordingly.
* The Respondent failed to establish a site office and commence work at the main dam and canal sites, despite receiving mobilization advance payments.
* The Respondent's failure to commence work amounted to a breach of contract.
* The Respondent's claim for compensation was not justifiable as the contract explicitly excluded claims for delays due to legal formalities or circumstances beyond the State Government's control.
* The Appellant's counter-claim was valid and should have been considered.

**Appellant’s Argument (Appellant before the High Court):**

* The Arbitrator failed to properly consider the relevant terms and conditions of the contract, including provisions that excluded claims for losses due to land acquisition delays.
* The Arbitrator's findings regarding a fundamental breach of contract were perverse and unsupported by evidence.
* The Arbitrator's award for loss of profit was without proper justification and evidence.
* The Arbitrator's decision to reject the Appellant's counter-claim was incorrect.
* The Commercial Court erred in upholding the Arbitral Award.

**Respondent’s Argument (Respondent before the High Court):**

* The Arbitral Award did not warrant interference as the Arbitrator had applied his mind to the matter and reached a permissible view.
* The court could not reappraise the evidence and substitute its own findings for those of the Arbitrator unless the award was demonstrably perverse.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

**Key Findings:**

* The court accepted the Appellant's argument that the Arbitrator failed to properly consider the terms and conditions of the contract, including provisions excluding claims for losses due to land acquisition delays.
* The court found the Arbitrator's findings regarding a fundamental breach of contract to be perverse, given that the Respondent was aware of the land acquisition challenges and should have planned accordingly.
* The court held that the Arbitrator's award for loss of profit was without proper justification and evidence, relying on the precedent in M/s Unibros vs. All India Radio (SLP (Civil) No. 8791 of 2020).

**Interpretation of Law:**

* The court interpreted the "patent illegality" provision under Section 34(2-A) of the Act of 1996, as introduced by the 2015 Amendment, to encompass findings based on no evidence or ignoring vital evidence.
* The court relied on the precedent in Ssangyong Engineering and Construction Company Ltd. vs. NHAI (2019) 15 SCC 131 regarding the scope of interference with arbitral awards under the 2015 Amendment.

**Application of Law:**

* The court applied the legal doctrines of fundamental breach of contract, frustration of contract, patent illegality, and perversity to the facts of the case.
