* **Case Name:** Jageshwar Dayal vs. K K Kapoor
* **Court:** Delhi High Court
* **Date of Judgment:** 09 July 2024
* **Citation:**  [Not Provided in the text]

## 2. Background and Context

* **Brief Overview:** This case involved a dispute over payments for piping work done by Jageshwar Dayal (petitioner) for K K Kapoor (respondent). After receiving partial payments, Dayal claimed that Kapoor refused to pay the remaining amount. The dispute initially went through the Tis Hazari Courts, where jurisdiction was determined to be in the Dwarka Courts. The petitioner then filed a suit in the Dwarka Courts, which was later returned on grounds of the dispute being commercial in nature, requiring filing in the Commercial Court. This petition challenges those rulings.
* **Key Issues:**
    * Whether the Delhi High Court can transfer the suit to the Commercial Court despite the lower court's order returning the plaint.
    * Whether the suit was correctly filed under the provisions of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015.
    * Whether the petitioner was provided adequate opportunity to address the return of the plaint.
    * Whether the petitioner missed the limitation period for filing the suit in the Dwarka Courts.
    * Whether the lower court was correct in dismissing the petitioner's review petition.

## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Plaintiff’s Argument (Petitioner):**
    * The lower court's suo moto observations about the dispute being commercial were impermissible as the respondent did not raise this issue.
    * The lower court erred in dismissing the review petition despite the fact that the Commercial Court designation had been withdrawn.
    * The return of the plaint was improper under Section 15(2) of the Commercial Courts Act.
    * The lower court did not provide an opportunity to be heard before returning the plaint.
    * The lower court's decision was erroneous in both fact and law.
* **Defendant’s Argument (Respondent):**
    * The petition is not maintainable as the petitioner should have appealed the lower court's order under Order XLIII Rule 1(a) CPC.
    * The petitioner instituted the suit after the expiration of the limitation period, which is non-condonable.
    * Re-filing after the return of the plaint constitutes a fresh suit.
    * The suit is clearly commercial in nature and should be filed in the Commercial Court under the Commercial Courts Act.
    * The petitioner failed to file the suit within the specified time after receiving the plaint back from the Tis Hazari Courts.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:** The court acknowledged the petitioner's hardship in pursuing the case, as the plaint was returned twice. 
* **Interpretation of Law:** The court referenced its previous judgment in Namita Gupta vs. Suraj Holdings Limited, which held that even if there are defects in pleadings, the High Court can transfer a suit to the Commercial Court under Section 24 of the CPC. The court also emphasized that the power to transfer under Section 24 of the CPC remains despite the Commercial Courts Act.
* **Application of Law:** The court applied the principle that the interest of justice can be served by transferring the suit to the Commercial Court, even though it was returned by the lower court. The court also noted that the defendant (respondent) can still raise objections about the suit's maintainability in the Commercial Court. 

## 6. Judgment

* **Final Decision:** The Delhi High Court set aside the lower court's order.
* **Relief Granted:** The suit was transferred from the Additional District Judge (ADJ)-02, South-West District, Dwarka Courts, Delhi, to the District Judge (Commercial)-02, South-West District, Dwarka Courts, Delhi.
* **Orders:** Both parties were ordered to appear before the transferee court on 15.07.2024.

## 7. Implications

* **Impact on Law:** The judgment reinforces the High Court's power to transfer suits under Section 24 of the CPC, even in cases where the Commercial Courts Act applies and the lower court has returned the plaint.
* **Future Relevance:** The case provides a precedent for transferring commercial disputes to the Commercial Courts, even if the suit was initially filed in a regular civil court and subsequently returned due to jurisdictional issues.
* **Broader Context:** This case emphasizes the importance of resolving disputes in the appropriate court and the need to avoid unnecessary delays in litigation. 

## 8. Summary Points

* The Delhi High Court transferred the suit to the Commercial Court despite the lower court's decision to return the plaint.
* The court acknowledged the petitioner's hardship in pursuing the case due to multiple returns of the plaint.
