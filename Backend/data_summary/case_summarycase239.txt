## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Appellant's Argument:**
    * The ex parte injunction order was passed by the City Civil Court, but the case was subsequently transferred to the Commercial Court, rendering the earlier order invalid.
    * The ex parte injunction only prohibited the use of the trade names "MAHE" and "Manipal Groups," not other similar names.
    * The Company, which held the registered trademarks "MAHE" and "Manipal Groups," was not a party to the original suit, and the appellants' actions on behalf of the Company did not constitute a breach of the injunction order.
    * The appellants' actions were not willful disobedience but rather a result of their misunderstanding of the order.
    * The appellants had complied with the injunction order by removing the prohibited trade names.
    * The punishment imposed by the Commercial Court, including civil imprisonment and compensation, was disproportionate and excessive.
* **Respondent's Argument:**
    * The appellants were aware of the injunction order and continued to use the prohibited trade names despite the court order.
    * The ex parte injunction was not limited to "MAHE" and "Manipal Groups" but also prohibited the use of these words in conjunction with any other trademarks.
    * The appellants' actions on behalf of the Company, even if not a party to the original suit, constituted a breach of the injunction order because they were aware of the order and assisted in the violation.
    * The appellants' claim of misunderstanding the injunction order was not credible.
    * The punishment imposed by the Commercial Court was justified in light of the appellants' willful disobedience of the court order.

## 5. Courtâ€™s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The court found that the appellants were aware of the ex parte injunction order, even though they were not parties to the original suit.
    * The court interpreted the injunction order to encompass the use of "MAHE" and "Manipal Groups" not only individually but also in conjunction with other trade names.
    * The court concluded that the appellants' actions on behalf of the Company constituted a willful disobedience of the injunction order because they were aware of the order and participated in the decision-making process that led to the violation.
    * The court found that the punishment imposed by the Commercial Court for payment of compensation was ultra vires the provisions of Order XXXIX Rule 2A of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.
    * The court concluded that civil imprisonment of 3 months imposed on Appellant No. 1 was disproportionate and excessive, while the imprisonment imposed on Appellants No. 2 and 3 was unjustified. 
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The court emphasized the broad scope of Order XXXIX Rule 2A of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, which allows for the punishment of any person who willfully disobeys a court order, even if they are not a party to the suit.
    * The court interpreted the ex parte injunction order to encompass the use of "MAHE" and "Manipal Groups" in conjunction with any other trade names.
    * The court clarified that the punishment for disobedience must be proportionate to the offense committed and must not violate the fundamental right to liberty enshrined in Article 21 of the Constitution of India.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The court applied the principles of willful disobedience to the appellants' actions and found them guilty of violating the injunction order.
    * The court applied the doctrine of proportionality to the punishment imposed by the Commercial Court and found that the duration of civil imprisonment imposed on Appellant No. 1 was excessive.
    * The court also considered the specific circumstances surrounding the appellants' actions and their roles in the Company and found that the punishment imposed on Appellants No. 2 and 3 was unjustified.
