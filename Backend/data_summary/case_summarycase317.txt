* **Res judicata:** A legal doctrine preventing a party from relitigating an issue that has already been decided by a competent court.

* **Principles of equity, justice, and good conscience:** These principles guide the application of equitable doctrines and are considered by courts when exercising discretion.

## 4. Arguments Presented

**Plaintiff’s Argument:**

* The respondent's claim for set-off was time-barred, having not been raised in the original written statement and being filed after several years.
* The Commercial Courts Act, 2015 does not permit amendments that introduce time-barred claims.
* Allowing the amendment would be prejudicial to the plaintiff and against the principles of justice.

**Defendant’s Argument:**

* The claim was based on equitable set-off, which is not subject to the Law of Limitation.
* Amendments can be allowed even if the relief sought is time-barred, at the discretion of the court.
* Pre-trial amendments should be granted liberally to ensure a fair trial.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

**Key Findings:**

* The court acknowledged that Section 8 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 bars revision under Section 115 of CPC, but did not bar revision under Article 227 of the Constitution.
* The court questioned the continued existence of a meaningful distinction between legal and equitable set-offs, considering the fusion of equity and law after the Judicature Acts in England.
* The court found that the respondent's claim for set-off was time-barred as it was not raised within the prescribed period of limitation, even considering the concept of equitable set-off.
* The court held that the Commercial Court erred in allowing the amendment as it essentially resurrected a time-barred claim.

**Interpretation of Law:**

* The court interpreted Article 227 of the Constitution as allowing revisions against interlocutory orders of Commercial Courts, even though Section 8 of the Commercial Courts Act bars revisions under Section 115 of CPC.
* The court carefully examined the nature of equitable set-off and its potential limitations, considering previous case law.
* The court applied Section 3 (2) (b) (i) of the Limitation Act, 1963 and Article 55 of the Limitation Act to determine the applicability of limitation to the respondent's claim for set-off.

**Application of Law:**

* The court applied the principles of equity, justice, and good conscience in determining whether the amendment should be allowed.
* The court applied the two tests mentioned in Pankaja v. Yellappa to assess the impact of the amendment on the ultimate cause of justice and the potential for further litigation.
* The court considered the mandatory nature of the proviso to Order VIII, Rule 1 of CPC, as amended by the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, in relation to the timing of filing written statements in Commercial Courts.
