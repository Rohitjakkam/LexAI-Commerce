## Case Title

* **Case Name:** Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited vs. Electricity Generation Incorporation & Ors.
* **Court:** Delhi High Court
* **Date of Judgment:** 19th September, 2017
* **Citation:** AIR 2018 DELHI 38

## Background and Context

* **Brief Overview:** Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL), a public sector undertaking, sued Electricity Generation Incorporation (EGI) for wrongfully terminating a contract for the rehabilitation of the Keban Hydroelectric Power Plant in Turkey.  EGI invoked a Performance Bank Guarantee (issued by AKBank) backed by a Counter Guarantee from Bank of Baroda (BoB). BHEL sought a declaration that the invocation of the guarantees was fraudulent and an injunction against payment.
* **Key Issues:** 
    * **Territorial Jurisdiction:**  Did the Delhi High Court have jurisdiction to hear the case, considering the Counter Guarantee specified London as the place of jurisdiction?
    * **Fraudulent Invocation:** Did EGI fraudulently invoke the Performance Bank Guarantee by terminating the contract without justification?

## Arguments Presented

* **Plaintiff’s Argument (BHEL):**
    * BHEL argued that the contract termination was unjustified and that EGI fraudulently invoked the guarantees to avoid its contractual obligations.
    * BHEL asserted that the Delhi High Court had jurisdiction because the Counter Guarantee was issued in Delhi and because there was a separate "omnibus agreement" between BHEL and BoB, though no evidence was provided for this agreement.
    * BHEL argued that the jurisdiction clause in the Counter Guarantee did not explicitly exclude all other courts.
    * BHEL argued that equity demanded the court intervene due to the fraud and injustice of EGI's actions.
    * BHEL claimed that proceeding in London would be inconvenient and time-consuming.
    * BHEL argued that the defendants could not be sued or a decree enforced against them in Ankara or London, making the Delhi High Court the only practical forum.
* **Defendant’s Argument (AKBank and BoB):**
    * AKBank and BoB argued that the Delhi High Court lacked territorial jurisdiction because the Counter Guarantee specifically designated the Commercial Court in London as the exclusive forum.
    * AKBank and BoB pointed out BHEL's admission in the plaint regarding London's jurisdiction and argued that they could not be subjected to the jurisdiction of the Delhi High Court.
    * AKBank and BoB claimed that the main contract between BHEL and EGI stipulated Ankara Courts as the forum for dispute resolution. 
    * AKBank and BoB argued that the issuance of the Counter Guarantee in Delhi was insufficient to establish jurisdiction.
    * AKBank and BoB argued that even if the Delhi High Court had some jurisdiction, the exclusive clause in the Counter Guarantee should be respected.
    * AKBank and BoB argued that BHEL's claim of paucity of time was not a valid justification for seeking jurisdiction in Delhi. 

## Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The court acknowledged the principle that bank guarantees are independent contracts.
    * The court found that the ouster clause in the Counter Guarantee, despite not using the word "only," clearly designated the Commercial Court in London as the exclusive forum.
    * The court rejected BHEL's argument about an "omnibus agreement" due to lack of evidence.
    * The court concluded that the issuance of the Counter Guarantee in Delhi was not sufficient to establish jurisdiction.
    * The court rejected BHEL's claim of "strong and compelling reasons" to override the jurisdiction clause because the claim was based on a lack of time, which was not a recognized exception.
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The court interpreted the Counter Guarantee's jurisdiction clause in accordance with the precedent set in **A.B.C. Laminart** and **Swastik Gases**, finding that the clear intent was to vest exclusive jurisdiction in London.
    * The court relied on the **Hindustan Steel** and **U.P. State Sugar** decisions to emphasize the limited exceptions to the general rule of honoring bank guarantees. 
* **Application of Law:**
    * The court applied the principle of **expressio unius est exclusio alterius**, finding that the specification of London as the forum implicitly excluded other courts.
    * The court applied the precedent set in **South East Asia** and **Hellenic Electricity**, holding that issuance of a bank guarantee within a specific jurisdiction does not automatically establish jurisdiction for disputes related to that guarantee. 

## Judgment

* **Final Decision:**  The court held that the Delhi High Court lacked territorial jurisdiction to hear the case due to the exclusive jurisdiction clause in the Counter Guarantee.
* **Relief Granted:** None.
* **Orders:** 
    * The plaint was returned to be filed in the Commercial Court in London.
    * The existing interim order in favor of BHEL was extended for 45 days to allow BHEL to file the suit in the appropriate court.

## Implications

* **Impact on Law:** This case reinforces the principle that parties can contractually agree to vest exclusive jurisdiction in a specific court, even if that court is located outside the country.  It further highlights the importance of clearly drafted ouster clauses.
* **Future Relevance:** This case serves as a precedent for future disputes concerning bank guarantees and jurisdiction clauses.  Parties should be mindful of drafting clear and unambiguous ouster clauses if they wish to specify a particular forum for disputes.
* **Broader Context:** The case demonstrates the challenges that can arise in international commercial disputes, where the parties may be subject to different legal systems and jurisdictions. 

## Summary Points

* **Key Takeaways:**
    *  Bank guarantees are independent contracts and must be honored unless fraud or irretrievable injustice is proven.
    * Clear ouster clauses in bank guarantees are binding and will be respected by courts.
    *  Jurisdiction in bank guarantee disputes is determined based on the terms of the guarantee, not the underlying contract.
    * Paucity of time is not a valid reason to override a contractual jurisdiction clause.
