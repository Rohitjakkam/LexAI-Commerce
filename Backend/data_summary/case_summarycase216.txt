## 2. Background and Context

* **Brief Overview:**  This case arises from a dispute related to a concession agreement for the development of Baramunda Bus Terminal in Odisha. The Odisha State Road Transport Corporation (OSRTC), the petitioner, entered into a concession agreement with the ARSS Bus Terminal Pvt. Ltd. (ARSS), the respondent, in 2011. The agreement was subsequently declared void ab initio by the Orissa High Court in 2012, leading to the termination of the agreement in 2013. Following this, a series of legal proceedings took place in both the Orissa High Court and the Bombay High Court, ultimately culminating in an arbitration proceeding between OSRTC and ARSS.
* **Key Issues:** 
    * The validity of the interest awarded by the arbitration tribunal on the amounts deposited by ARSS, particularly in light of the Bombay High Court's restraining order.

    * The arbitration tribunal erred in awarding interest on the first installment amount of Rs. 18,66,66,667/- for the period from 23.08.2010 to 05.10.2015 and on the non-refundable amount of Rs. 2,33,24,038/- for the period from 28.08.2010 to 30.10.2021.
    * The petitioner was not liable to pay interest on the first installment amount for the period from 30.05.2013 to 05.10.2015 due to the restraining order from the Bombay High Court. 
    * The petitioner was not liable to pay any interest on the non-refundable amount.
    * The commercial court erred in directing the petitioner to deposit the entire awarded amount without considering the petitioner's arguments regarding interest. 

* **Respondent’s Argument:**
    * The writ petition is not maintainable against the commercial court's order under Section 36(3) of the Arbitration Act.
    * The commercial court's order to deposit the entire award amount is consistent with the Supreme Court's decision in Navayuga Engineering Company (supra).
    * The petitioner's arguments regarding interest are already subject to the final determination of the commercial court in the arbitration proceeding.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:** 
    * The court finds that while the scope of judicial intervention in arbitration matters is limited, a writ petition under Article 227 of the Constitution is maintainable in exceptional cases.
    * The court acknowledges that the petitioner was restrained from making the first installment payment due to the Bombay High Court's order. 
    * The court finds that the commercial court did not adequately consider the petitioner's arguments regarding interest awarded by the arbitration tribunal. 

* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The court interprets Section 5 of the Arbitration Act as providing for limited judicial intervention, but not an absolute bar.
    * The court emphasizes the discretionary nature of the High Court's power under Article 227 and its application in exceptional circumstances.

* **Application of Law:** 
    * The court applies the principles laid down in the precedents cited, particularly Bhaben Construction (supra), Deep Industries (supra), and Punjab Agro Industries (supra) to determine the maintainability of the writ petition.
    * The court finds that the commercial court's direction to deposit the entire award amount was not just and proper, given the petitioner's previous deposit of the first installment amount.

## 6. Judgment

* **Final Decision:** 
    * The court upholds the maintainability of the writ petition.
    * The court intervenes with the commercial court's order and allows the petitioner to deposit only 60% of the awarded amount within one month.
