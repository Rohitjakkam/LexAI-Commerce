    * Territorial Jurisdiction: This doctrine governs the power of a court to adjudicate a dispute based on the location of the parties or property involved.
    * Principles of Natural Justice: This doctrine requires fair play and a reasonable opportunity for a party to be heard before a court makes a decision affecting their interests.
    * Res Judicata: This doctrine prevents the relitigation of an issue that has already been decided by a competent court.
    * Waiver/Latches: This doctrine relates to the loss of a legal right due to delay or inaction in pursuing a claim.

**4. Arguments Presented**

* **Judgment Debtor’s Argument:**
    * The executing court lacked territorial jurisdiction to execute the decree personally against him as he is a permanent resident of Kolkata, where the decree holder had also served him.
    * The executing court denied him natural justice by passing the order under Order XXI Rule 41(1) without giving him a proper opportunity to file his reply and objections.
    * The decree holder was making frivolous and baseless allegations against him, and the executing court was allowing such conduct without any basis.
    * The executing court improperly declared him as 'absconding' without any legal basis.
    * There was no delay on his part in raising the jurisdictional challenge.

* **Decree Holder’s Argument:**
    * The executing court had jurisdiction to execute the decree against the judgment debtor as he carries on business and owns immovable property within the court's jurisdiction.
    * The judgment debtor failed to raise objections to the court's jurisdiction at the first available opportunity, as required under Section 21 of the CPC.
    * The judgment debtor's actions demonstrated a clear pattern of delay and attempts to obstruct the execution process. 
    * The judgment debtor's argument about the court's finding of 'absconding' was a misinterpretation of the law.
    * The judgment debtor's delay in challenging the orders barred him from seeking relief in the High Court.

**5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning**

* **Key Findings:**
    * The court concluded that the executing court in Jamnagar had territorial jurisdiction to execute the decree against the judgment debtor.
    * The court found that the judgment debtor had numerous opportunities to raise the jurisdictional challenge but failed to do so at the earliest opportunity.
    * The court determined that the judgment debtor's conduct exhibited a pattern of delay and obstruction in the execution process. 
    * The court rejected the judgment debtor's claim that he was denied natural justice by the executing court. 
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The court interpreted Section 39 of the CPC to mean that a court can execute a decree against a person or property situated within its territorial jurisdiction, even if the judgment debtor resides elsewhere.
    * The court interpreted Section 21 of the CPC to require the raising of jurisdictional objections at the first available opportunity, failing which such objections may be barred. 
* **Application of Law:**
    * The court applied the principles of territorial jurisdiction to the specific facts of the case, considering the judgment debtor's business activities and property ownership in Jamnagar.
    * The court applied the doctrine of waiver/latches to find that the judgment debtor's delay in challenging the executing court's orders barred his plea in the High Court. 
    * The court considered the relevant precedents cited by both parties and distinguished the cases where the facts were significantly different.

**6. Judgment**

* **Final Decision:** The court rejected both Special Civil Applications filed by the judgment debtor.
* **Relief Granted:** None.
* **Orders:** The court directed the judgment debtor to pay Rs. 25,000/- in costs to the decree holder within four weeks.

* **Future Relevance:** This case provides valuable guidance to courts and parties involved in execution proceedings concerning the interpretation and application of territorial jurisdiction and procedural delays. 
* **Broader Context:** This case highlights the potential for procedural tactics to delay and frustrate the execution of decrees, and the importance of courts preventing such tactics.
