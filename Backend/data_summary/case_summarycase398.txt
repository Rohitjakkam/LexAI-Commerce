    * The Respondent's appeal was not maintainable in light of the Division Bench judgment in Alexander Luke [2024 KHC OnLine 107].

* **Respondent’s Argument:** 
    * The Commercial Court's order granting conditional attachment was not a final order and therefore appealable in the High Court under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act.
    * There was a distinction between a final order and an ad-interim order, which could be challenged in the High Court.
    * The High Court should not have recalled its judgment in the appeal and should not have dismissed the appeal as not maintainable.
