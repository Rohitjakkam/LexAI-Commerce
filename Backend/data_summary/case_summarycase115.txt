## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Plaintiff’s Argument (Barminco):**
    * Barminco argued that the arbitration agreement in the contract, which stipulated Singapore as the seat of arbitration,  made it an "International Commercial Arbitration" under the Act of 1996.
    * They emphasized that the seat of arbitration being outside India,  Part I of the Act of 1996 did not apply, thus rendering the definition of "International Commercial Arbitration" in Section 2(1)(f) irrelevant.
    * They relied on the amendment made in Section 2(2) of the Act of 1996, allowing Indian courts to intervene in certain cases of international commercial arbitration even if the seat of arbitration was outside India.
    * They claimed the High Court had jurisdiction under Section 9 of the Act of 1996 based on its ordinary original civil jurisdiction and the fact that the dispute involved a foreign award.

* **Defendant’s Argument (HZL):**
    * HZL argued that the arbitration was not "International Commercial Arbitration" because both parties were incorporated in India and thus had Indian nationality.
    * They claimed that the "International Commercial Arbitration" criteria under Section 2(1)(f) of the Act of 1996 were not met.
    * They pointed out that the seat of arbitration alone was not sufficient to determine the nature of the arbitration.
    * They asserted that the High Court did not have jurisdiction based on the interpretation of the Act of 1996 by the Supreme Court in the cited cases.
    * They argued that Barminco's non-disclosure of its status as an Indian LLP constituted a material misrepresentation.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:** 
    * The Court acknowledged that the seat of arbitration being outside India would make the resulting award a foreign award.
    * It found that the definition of "International Commercial Arbitration" in the Act of 1996, despite being part of Part I, applied to the entire Act.
    * The Court emphasized that the nationality of the parties is the primary determinant for classifying an arbitration as "International Commercial Arbitration."
    * It recognized that the amendment in Section 2(2) of the Act of 1996 addressed certain jurisdictional concerns regarding international arbitration. 
    * The Court acknowledged that the High Court of Rajasthan does not exercise original civil jurisdiction.

* **Interpretation of Law:** 
    * The Court interpreted the provisions of Section 2(1)(e) and 2(1)(f) of the Act of 1996 to determine the jurisdictional framework for applications under Section 9.
    * It acknowledged the principle of statutory interpretation and applied it to resolve the anomaly arising from the definition clause in the Act of 1996.

* **Application of Law:** 
    * The Court applied the definition of "International Commercial Arbitration" to the facts of the case, finding that both parties' Indian nationality meant the arbitration was not international.
    * It applied the provision of Section 2(1)(e) of the Act of 1996 to conclude that the High Court did not have jurisdiction as the arbitration was not "International Commercial Arbitration."
    * It also applied Section 10(3) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, concluding that the Commercial Court in Udaipur would have jurisdiction.

## 6. Judgment

## 7. Implications

* **Impact on Law:** The judgment clarified the interpretation of "International Commercial Arbitration" under the Act of 1996, emphasizing the relevance of nationality of the parties over the seat of arbitration. It also provided guidance on the jurisdictional framework for applications under Section 9 of the Act of 1996.

    * The seat of arbitration alone does not automatically make an arbitration international.
