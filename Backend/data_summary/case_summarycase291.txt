## 2. Background and Context

## 3. Legal Principles Involved

* **Relevant Statutes and Provisions:**
    * The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, particularly Sections 17, 2(1)(c)4, 32, 33, and 34.
    * The Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908).
* **Precedents Cited:**
    * The Project Director, National Highways Nos.45E and 220, National Highways Authority of India vs. M.Hakeem and others
    * Ragya Bee and others vs. P.S.R. Constructions and others
    * Delhi Airport Metro Express Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Ltd.
* **Legal Doctrines:**
    * **Functus officio:** A principle that once an arbitrator has passed an award, they lose jurisdiction to deal with the same matter.
    * **Deemed stay:** Under the relevant provision of the Arbitration Act, 1996, filing an application under Section 34 automatically stays the execution of the arbitral award. 
    * **Public Policy:** The court considers whether the arbitral award conflicts with the public policy of India.
    * **Patent Illegality:** The court examines whether there are any obvious and fundamental errors of law in the award.

## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Appellant’s Argument:**
    * The Commercial Court erred in modifying the Arbitrator's award as Section 34 only allows for setting aside or remanding of the award, not modification.
    * The Commercial Court incorrectly interpreted the Government Order regarding electricity bills, making the revision of rates prospective instead of retrospective.
    * The reduction of interest rate from 12% to 6% was unjustified.
* **Respondent’s Argument:**
    * The Government Order was only applicable to new contracts, not the existing agreements with the companies.
    * The Arbitrator's conclusion regarding electricity bills was perverse and inconsistent with other findings.
    * The Arbitrator had no power to pass a final award after the application under Section 34 challenging the preliminary award was filed.
    * The Arbitrator's interim order, extending the contracts beyond the stipulated period, was beyond his jurisdiction.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The court found that the Arbitrator's decision to pass a preliminary award followed by a final award is not permissible under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.
    * The court determined that the Commercial Court had no jurisdiction to modify the Arbitrator's award under Section 34.
    * The court held that the final award passed by the Arbitrator was invalid as it was passed after an application under Section 34 challenging the preliminary award was filed.
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The court emphasized the limited role of the court under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act, 1996, highlighting that the court cannot modify the arbitral award.
    * The court interpreted the Act to mean that an Arbitrator can only pass one final award and cannot split it into preliminary and final awards.
    * The court clarified the scope of deemed stay on filing an application under Section 34.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The court applied the legal principles of functus officio and deemed stay to the specific facts of the case, finding that the Arbitrator had acted beyond his jurisdiction.
    * The court applied the precedent judgments on the limited scope of Section 34 to conclude that the Commercial Court's modification of the award was incorrect.

## 6. Judgment

* **Final Decision:**
    * The court allowed the appeals filed by the companies, Mee Seva, and United Telecoms Limited.
    * The court set aside the Arbitrator's award and the Commercial Court's decision.
* **Relief Granted:**
    * The case was remanded back to arbitration, with a new Arbitrator (Sri Justice Vilas V. Afzulpurkar) appointed.
* **Orders:**
    * The parties were instructed to submit all the documents and pleadings from the previous arbitration to the new Arbitrator.
    * The new Arbitrator was requested to conclude the proceedings expeditiously within 16 weeks.

## 7. Implications

* **Impact on Law:**
    * The judgment clarifies the interpretation of Section 34 of the Arbitration Act, 1996, reiterating the limited scope of the court's intervention in arbitral awards.
    * It emphasizes the principle of functus officio, limiting the Arbitrator's powers after passing an award.
* **Future Relevance:**
    * This case will be a valuable precedent for future cases involving disputes regarding arbitral awards, particularly when challenging awards on procedural grounds.
* **Broader Context:**
    * The judgment highlights the importance of ensuring the integrity of the arbitration process, ensuring that the Arbitrator acts within their jurisdiction and adheres to the procedural requirements.

## 8. Summary Points

* The Arbitrator erred by passing two awards – a preliminary and final award – which is not permitted under the Arbitration Act.
* The Commercial Court overstepped its authority by modifying the Arbitrator's award under Section 34, which only allows for setting aside or remanding of the award.
* The court emphasized the limited role of the court in arbitral proceedings, underscoring the need to minimize judicial interference.
* The case was sent back to arbitration with a new Arbitrator to ensure a fair and proper resolution.
