## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Appellant's Argument:** 
    * The petitioners argued that the Commercial Court's order terminating the arbitrator's mandate was incorrect, primarily based on the grounds of undue delay and bias.
    * They contended that the delay was not due to the arbitrator's fault but was caused by the respondents' actions and their participation in the proceedings after the prescribed time limit.
    * They argued that the respondents waived their right to object to the delay by participating in the proceedings and even by appealing to the Supreme Court against the High Court's order setting a time limit.
    * They challenged the applicability of the 2015 Amendment Act to the case, arguing that the arbitration proceedings began before the Amendment Act came into force.
* **Respondent's Argument:** 
    * The respondents argued that the High Court lacked jurisdiction to entertain a CRP under Article 227 because the Commercial Courts Act restricted such revisions.
    * They asserted that the arbitrator failed to complete the proceedings within the time limit fixed by the High Court, leading to the automatic termination of his mandate.
    * They claimed that the petitioners had not raised any objections regarding the time limit in the previous proceedings and that their participation in the proceedings after the stipulated period did not constitute a waiver.
    * They argued that the 2015 Amendment Act applied to the case, as the amendment was prospective and applied to Court proceedings commenced after the Act came into force.

## 5. Courtâ€™s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The Court held that the High Court's supervisory jurisdiction under Article 227 of the Constitution was not taken away by the Commercial Courts Act. The Court clarified that while Section 8 of the Act restricted revisions against interlocutory orders, it did not bar the High Court's constitutional jurisdiction under Article 227.
    * The Court found that the respondents had participated in the proceedings after the time limit set by the High Court without raising any objections regarding the delay. 
    * The Court emphasized that the delay was not solely the arbitrator's fault, and the respondents had actively contributed to it through their own actions.
    * The Court determined that the 2015 Amendment Act did not apply to the case as the arbitration proceedings had begun before the Amendment Act came into effect.
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The Court extensively discussed the legal principles governing the High Court's supervisory jurisdiction under Article 227 and its application in the context of the Commercial Courts Act.
    * The Court carefully analyzed the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, particularly Section 14, which deals with the termination of an arbitrator's mandate due to undue delay. 
    * The Court interpreted Section 26 of the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015, to establish that the Amendment Act was prospective in nature and did not apply to arbitral proceedings commenced before the date of its implementation.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The Court applied the legal principles discussed to the specific facts of the case, examining the sequence of events and the conduct of the parties.
    * The Court weighed the arguments presented by both sides, meticulously analyzing the evidence and precedents cited.
    * Based on its analysis, the Court determined that the Commercial Court's order terminating the arbitrator's mandate was incorrect and unjustified.

## 6. Judgment

* **Final Decision:** The Court allowed the Civil Revision Petition and set aside the order of the Commercial Court terminating the arbitrator's mandate.
* **Relief Granted:** The petitioners were granted the relief of having the arbitrator's mandate reinstated.
* **Orders:** The Court ordered the Commercial Court to refrain from interfering with the arbitrator's mandate and directed the parties to proceed with the arbitration proceedings under the original 1996 Act.

## 7. Implications

* **Impact on Law:** The judgment reaffirms the High Court's constitutional jurisdiction under Article 227, even in cases where specific statutes like the Commercial Courts Act might seem to restrict such jurisdiction. It emphasizes that the High Court's supervisory power is vital for maintaining the smooth functioning of the judicial system and upholding justice.
* **Future Relevance:** The case serves as a precedent for future cases where the application of the 2015 Amendment Act to pending arbitral proceedings is challenged. It clarifies the distinction between arbitral proceedings and Court proceedings in relation to arbitration, as outlined in Section 26 of the Amendment Act.
* **Broader Context:** The judgment highlights the importance of parties acting in good faith and cooperating with the arbitration process. It underscores the potential consequences of delaying tactics and their impact on the efficient resolution of disputes.

## 8. Summary Points

* The High Court retained its supervisory jurisdiction under Article 227, despite the Commercial Courts Act.
* The arbitrator's mandate was reinstated due to undue delay and the respondents' contribution to the delay.
* The 2015 Amendment Act was not applicable to the case, as the arbitration proceedings commenced before the Act came into effect.
