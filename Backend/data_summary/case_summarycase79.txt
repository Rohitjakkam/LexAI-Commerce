## 4. Arguments Presented

**Appellant’s Argument:**

1. The Appellant's letter proposing foreclosure of the contract did not constitute a waiver of their right to claim "Loss of Profit." 
2. The Tribunal correctly awarded "Loss of Profit" based on the Respondent's fundamental breach of the contract, which led to its termination.
3. The Respondent's contributory delay was considered by the Tribunal, and the awarded "Loss of Profit" was fair and reasonable.
4. The Commercial Court erred by substituting its own views for those of the Tribunal, exceeding the scope of Section 34 of the Arbitration Act.

**Respondent’s Argument:**

1. The Appellant's undertaking not to claim compensation if the contract was foreclosed was a waiver of their right to "Loss of Profit."
2. The Respondent's breach was not fundamental, and the Appellant's own actions in terminating the contract caused the alleged "Loss of Profit."
3. The Appellant had underbid the contract and thus, was not likely to have earned any profit even if the contract had been completed.
4. The Tribunal wrongly interpreted the Contract and applied the concept of "fundamental breach" inappropriately.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

**Key Findings:**

1. The Court found that the Appellant's letter proposing foreclosure did not constitute a waiver of their right to claim "Loss of Profit" because the foreclosure did not materialize. The "without prejudice" statement in the letter was correctly interpreted by the Tribunal and did not indicate a waiver of all legal rights.
2. The Court agreed with the Tribunal's finding of a fundamental breach of the contract by the Respondent, which justified the Appellant's termination and the award of "Loss of Profit."
3. The Court found that the Tribunal's computation of "Loss of Profit" at 50% of the original claim was fair and reasonable, considering the Respondent's contributory delay and the Appellant's own actions. 
4. The Court concluded that the Commercial Court had exceeded its powers under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act by substituting its own views for those of the Tribunal.

**Interpretation of Law:**

1. The Court reiterated the limitations on the Commercial Court's power under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act, emphasizing that the Court cannot act as a first appellate court or reappreciate evidence. 
2. The Court highlighted that the "patent illegality" required for setting aside an Arbitral Award must go to the root of the matter, not be a mere error in applying the law. 
3. The Court reaffirmed the principle that the Arbitral Tribunal is the master of evidence and that its findings should not be interfered with unless they are perverse or against public policy.

**Application of Law:**

The Court applied these legal principles to the specific facts of the case, concluding that the Commercial Court's decision to set aside the "Loss of Profit" award was not justified.

## 6. Judgment

**Final Decision:** The Court allowed the Appellant's appeal and set aside the Commercial Court's order. The Award passed by the Arbitral Tribunal, including the "Loss of Profit" award, was restored.

**Relief Granted:** The Appellant was granted the "Loss of Profit" award as determined by the Arbitral Tribunal.

**Orders:** The Court ordered that the parties bear their own costs.

## 7. Implications

**Impact on Law:** This judgment reaffirms the importance of respecting the finality of Arbitral Awards and the limitations of judicial intervention under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act. It emphasizes the principle that Courts should not substitute their own views for those of the Tribunal unless the Award is patently illegal or perverse. 

**Future Relevance:** This case will serve as a valuable precedent for future disputes involving the interpretation of "fundamental breach" and the award of "Loss of Profit" in contract termination cases. It also highlights the importance of clear and specific contractual clauses defining essential terms and payment obligations.

**Broader Context:** This case underscores the importance of efficient and effective dispute resolution mechanisms, particularly in the context of large infrastructure projects. The judgment encourages parties to carefully draft contracts and consider the potential consequences of breaches. 

## 8. Summary Points
