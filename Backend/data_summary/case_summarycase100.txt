## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Petitioner's Argument:**
    * The award of the Statutory Arbitrator was incorrect in classifying their land as agricultural and failing to compensate them at residential rates.
    * The petitioners argued that they had a valid claim to compensation under the Act of 1956 and that the Commercial Court had jurisdiction to hear their application under Section 34 of the Act of 1996.
* **Respondent's Argument:**
    * The Statutory Arbitrator's award was final and binding, and the petitioners' remedy lay with the Land Acquisition and Rehabilitation and Resettlement Authority under the Act of 2013.
    * They argued that the petitioners' application under Section 34 of the Act of 1996 was not maintainable before the Commercial Court.

## 5. Court's Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The court found that the Commercial Court was mistaken in dismissing the application under Section 34 of the Act of 1996 on the grounds that the Statutory Arbitrator's award could not be challenged.
    * The court clarified that the application of the Act of 2013 to acquisitions under the Act of 1956 was limited to compensation and did not subsume the entire legal framework of the Act of 1956.
    * The court held that the dispute did not constitute a "commercial dispute" under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, and the application under Section 34 should not have been filed before the Commercial Court.
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The court interpreted Section 3G(6) of the Act of 1956 to conclude that the provisions of the Act of 1996 were applicable to arbitration proceedings under the Act of 1956, including the right to challenge awards under Section 34.
    * The court interpreted the provisions of the Act of 2013 and the precedents, specifically *Tarsem Singh*, to establish that the application of the Act of 2013 to acquisitions under the Act of 1956 was limited to specific areas of compensation and resettlement.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The court applied the principles of statutory interpretation and land acquisition law to determine that the petitioners had a right to challenge the Statutory Arbitrator's award under Section 34 of the Act of 1996.
    * The court applied the definition of "commercial dispute" in the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, to conclude that the land acquisition dispute did not meet the criteria for being classified as a commercial dispute.

## 6. Judgment

* **Final Decision:** The petition was dismissed.
* **Relief Granted:** None, as the court did not have jurisdiction to hear the application under Section 34 of the Act of 1996.
* **Orders:** The court clarified that upon return of the application, the petitioners could, subject to the law of limitation, file proceedings before the court of competent jurisdiction to hear an application under Section 34 of the Act of 1996.

## 7. Implications

* **Future Relevance:** This case provides valuable guidance for future cases involving land acquisition under the Act of 1956, especially regarding the proper forum for challenging arbitration awards.
* **Broader Context:** This case highlights the ongoing tension between the Act of 1956 and the Act of 2013, particularly regarding the application of the latter to acquisitions made under the former.

## 8. Summary Points
