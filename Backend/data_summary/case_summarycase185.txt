## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Plaintiff's Argument:**
    * The plaintiff company argued that it was not served with proper notice before the cancellation of the lease agreement. They contended that NOIDA sent notices to the residential address of a director, not the registered office of the company, as mandated by the lease agreement. 
    * The plaintiff company argued that the cancellation of the lease agreement was illegal and sought a declaration that the cancellation notice was null and void. They also sought a permanent injunction restraining NOIDA from interfering with their possession of the plot and from executing a lease deed with the defendant company.
    * They argued that the dispute was a "commercial dispute" as defined under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, and that the commercial court had jurisdiction.
* **Defendant's Argument:**
    * NOIDA argued that the plaintiff company breached the lease agreement by failing to complete construction and make timely payments. They asserted that they sent notices to the plaintiff company at the available address, which included the address of the director, and that the notices were properly served. 
    * NOIDA also contended that the commercial court had no jurisdiction as the dispute did not fall under the definition of a "commercial dispute" because the property was not "actually used" for trade or commerce. 
    * NOIDA argued that the plaintiff company had deliberately abandoned the project and failed to comply with the terms of the lease agreement. 
    * The defendant company, M/s Innova A.M. Tech L.L.P, argued that they had a valid contract with NOIDA to purchase the plot and that the plaintiff company had no right to interfere with their acquisition of the land.
    * They also pointed out that the plaintiff company was essentially an inactive shell company and was not legally entitled to the plot.

## 5. Court's Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The High Court found that the commercial court had incorrectly concluded that the dispute between NOIDA and the plaintiff company was a "commercial dispute" under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015.
    * The court held that the property was not "actually used" for trade or commerce at the time of lease cancellation. The fact that the property was "likely to be used" for such purpose was not sufficient to establish jurisdiction under the Act.
    * The court found that the plaintiff company had failed to comply with the terms of the lease agreement, including timely construction and payments. 
    * The court acknowledged that the plaintiff company had received proper notice of cancellation, even if they were not served at their registered office.
    * The court also accepted NOIDA's argument that the plaintiff company was an inactive company with no genuine business operations.
* **Interpretation of Law:** The court relied on various precedents to interpret the definition of "commercial dispute" in the Commercial Courts Act, 2015.  They emphasized that the word "used" in the context of the Act signifies "actually used" and not "likely to be used" or "ready for use." 
* **Application of Law:** The court applied the legal principles to the facts of the case and concluded that the commercial court had no jurisdiction to decide the dispute. They held that the plaintiff company was not entitled to the relief granted by the commercial court.

## 6. Judgment

* **Final Decision:** The Allahabad High Court allowed both appeals and set aside the judgment and decree of the Commercial Court dated 28.03.2022.
* **Relief Granted:** The court effectively reversed the commercial court's decision, reaffirming the cancellation of the lease agreement by NOIDA. 
* **Orders:** The court declared that the cancellation notice dated 07.01.2021 was valid and binding, and that NOIDA was entitled to re-allot the plot to the defendant company.

## 7. Implications

* **Impact on Law:** This judgment clarifies the scope of the definition of "commercial dispute" under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, particularly regarding agreements for immovable property. It reinforces the need for properties to be "actually used" for trade or commerce for disputes to fall under the Act's jurisdiction.
* **Future Relevance:** This case serves as a precedent for future cases involving disputes arising from lease agreements for immovable property, particularly where the property is not actively used for trade or commerce. It may also influence decisions regarding the interpretation of the "used exclusively in trade and commerce" provision in other contexts.
* **Broader Context:** This case highlights the importance of parties complying with the terms of lease agreements and emphasizes the consequences of default. It also underscores the need for commercial courts to strictly adhere to their jurisdictional limits under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015.

## 8. Summary Points

* The Allahabad High Court determined that the dispute between NOIDA and the plaintiff company did not constitute a "commercial dispute" under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, as the property was not "actually used" for trade or commerce.
* The court upheld NOIDA's cancellation of the lease agreement due to the plaintiff company's breach of contract, finding that proper notice was served.
* The judgment reinforces the need for strict interpretation of the "used exclusively in trade and commerce" provision in the Commercial Courts Act, 2015.
