## Arguments Presented

* **Plaintiff’s Argument (KSFC):**
    * KSFC argued that the Commercial Court had jurisdiction to entertain the execution proceedings under Section 6 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, as the dispute related to a "commercial dispute" as defined in Section 2(c).
    * They claimed that the execution proceedings were maintainable under Section 38 of the CPC, as the Commercial Court had been designated to handle cases originating from the City Civil Court.
    * KSFC further argued that the application (I.A.No.2) was maintainable under Order 21 Rule 52 of the CPC, allowing the attachment of property.
* **Defendant’s Argument (Smt Sarasamma .C):**
    * The petitioner argued that the Commercial Court lacked jurisdiction, as the dispute had already been adjudicated and concluded in the earlier case (Misc.No.521/2004). The execution proceedings were merely to enforce a previously decided matter and did not involve a "live/pending commercial dispute."
    * The petitioner also argued that the execution proceedings were not maintainable under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, as they did not fall within the scope of "commercial dispute" as defined by the Act.
    * The petitioner claimed that I.A.No.2 was not maintainable under Order 21 Rule 52 of the CPC, as the application was filed after a delay of 19 years and was barred by limitation. 

## Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * **Jurisdiction of the Commercial Court:** The court held that the Commercial Court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the execution proceedings. The court found that the dispute had already been resolved in the previous case and that the execution proceedings did not constitute a "commercial dispute" under the Act.
    * **Maintainability of the Execution Proceedings:** The court found that the execution proceedings were not maintainable under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, as they did not involve a "commercial dispute" as defined by the Act.
    * **Maintainability of I.A.No.2:** The court held that the application (I.A.No.2) was not maintainable under Order 21 Rule 52 of the CPC, as it was not properly invoked and the application was filed after a significant delay, rendering it barred by limitation.
* **Interpretation of Law:** The court meticulously analyzed the relevant provisions of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, the CPC, and the State Financial Corporations Act, 1951. The court emphasized the distinction between original disputes and execution proceedings, holding that execution proceedings do not constitute "commercial disputes" under the Act.
* **Application of Law:** The court applied the relevant legal principles to the facts of the case. It found that the transfer of the execution proceedings to the Commercial Court under the Bangalore City Civil Court Act, 1979, did not grant jurisdiction to the Commercial Court. The court also rejected the arguments based on the inherent powers of the court under Section 151 of the CPC.

## Judgment

* **Final Decision:** The petition filed by Smt Sarasamma .C was allowed.
* **Relief Granted:** The impugned order dated 21.01.2023 passed on I.A.No.2 in Commercial Execution No.2673/2018 by the LXXXVII Addl. City Civil Judge, (Exclusive Dedicated Commercial Court), Bengaluru was set aside.
* **Orders:**  I.A.2 filed by KSFC was dismissed.

## Implications

* **Impact on Law:** The judgment clarifies the scope of jurisdiction of the Commercial Courts under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, particularly in relation to execution proceedings. It reinforces that the Act primarily aims to adjudicate original commercial disputes and not to handle execution proceedings.
* **Future Relevance:** This case will be significant for future cases involving the transfer of execution proceedings to Commercial Courts. It highlights the need for courts to carefully assess whether the underlying dispute falls within the ambit of "commercial dispute" under the Act, and to ensure that the transfer of cases is in accordance with the provisions of the Act. 
* **Broader Context:** The case underscores the importance of clear and concise statutory provisions in defining the jurisdiction of specialized courts. It also emphasizes the need to balance the efficiency of specialized courts with the protection of individual rights and procedural safeguards.
