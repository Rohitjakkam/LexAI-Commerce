## 1. Case Title

* **Case Name:** Reliance General Insurance Co. Ltd vs Colonial Life Insurance Co (Trinidad) Ltd. & Anr.
* **Court:** Bombay High Court, Commercial Division
* **Date of Judgment:** 27th February 2019
* **Citation:** Not provided in the text, but can be found on the Bombay High Court website.

## 2. Background and Context

* **Brief Overview:** This case arose from a series of Commercial Suits filed before the Bombay High Court's Commercial Division. Various Defendants in these suits failed to file their written statements within the stipulated 120-day timeframe under the newly amended Order VIII Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC) introduced by the Commercial Courts Act, 2015. The Defendants then filed Notice of Motions seeking condonation of delay.
* **Key Issues:** The primary question of law was whether the Commercial Division could allow Defendants to file written statements beyond the 120-day limit mandated by the Commercial Courts Act's amendment to Order VIII Rule 1, considering the Court's powers under the Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules, 1980, and other procedural provisions like Order VIII Rules 9 and 10.

## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Plaintiff’s Argument:** 
    * The primary purpose of the Commercial Courts Act is to expedite the resolution of high-value commercial disputes.
    * The amendments to the CPC, particularly the proviso added to Order VIII Rule 1, are mandatory in nature and intended to eliminate any discretion in the Court to take written statements after 120 days. 
    * The legislature intended to override any conflicting rules of the Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules, as evidenced by Section 16(3) of the Commercial Courts Act.
    * Allowing the Defendants to file written statements beyond 120 days would defeat the entire purpose of the Commercial Courts Act and create an inconsistent application of the law across different High Courts.
    * The provisions of Order VIII Rule 9, as interpreted in cases like Shailaja, were applicable before the Commercial Courts Act and cannot be applied to Commercial Suits. 
    * Any reliance on Order VIII Rule 9 would render the provisions of Order VIII Rule 1 meaningless and would allow Defendants to circumvent the mandatory timeframe.
* **Defendant’s Argument:**
    * The Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules, being a special law, govern the procedure for Commercial Suits even after the Commercial Courts Act amendment.
    * The Commercial Courts Act does not expressly exclude the provisions of the Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules or the Letters Patent of the Bombay High Court.
    * The Court has discretion under Order VIII Rule 9 to take on record a written statement even after the 120-day period, as the bar applies only to the initial written statement mandated by Order VIII Rule 1.
    * The Court's power to condone delay under Order VIII Rule 9 should be exercised to prevent injustice and should not be restricted based on technicalities.
    * The Court has inherent powers under Section 151 of the CPC to pass orders to ensure the ends of justice, even if it means condoning the delay.
    * The concept of equity requires the Court to consider emergent circumstances faced by the Defendants and not strictly enforce the time limitations. 

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The Apex Court in M/s SCG Contracts India Pvt. Ltd. Vs. K.S. Chamankar Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. (supra) has definitively held that the amendments to Order VIII Rule 1 introduced by the Commercial Courts Act are mandatory. 
    * The Commercial Courts Act, being a special law, overrides the Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules in case of any conflict.
    * The court cannot invoke Order VIII Rule 9 to take written statements beyond the 120-day limit, as this would defeat the legislative intent of the Commercial Courts Act and render its provisions meaningless.
    * Equity cannot be used to override clear statutory provisions.
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The court analyzed the legislative history of the Commercial Courts Act and its intent to expedite commercial litigation.
    * It meticulously examined the language of the amended Order VIII Rule 1, emphasizing its mandatory nature.
    * The court interpreted the phrase "Rule of the jurisdictional High Court" in Section 16(3) of the Commercial Courts Act to include the Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules.
    * It highlighted the contrast between the limited non-obstante clause in the 2002 Amendment Act and the broader one in the Commercial Courts Act, emphasizing the legislature's clear intention to override any conflicting provisions.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The court applied the principles of harmonious construction and special law vs. general law to determine the priority of the Commercial Courts Act over the Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules.
    * It refused to apply precedents like Shailaja and Chintaman, which were decided before the Commercial Courts Act's amendment, finding them inapplicable to Commercial Suits.
    * It rejected the arguments based on the inherent powers of the Court under Section 151 of the CPC, emphasizing that these powers cannot be used to circumvent clear statutory provisions.
    * The court also considered the arguments based on the principle of equity, but ultimately held that equity cannot override the clear legislative mandate.

## 6. Judgment

* **Final Decision:** The court held that the Commercial Division cannot allow Defendants to file written statements beyond the 120-day limit mandated by the Commercial Courts Act's amendment to Order VIII Rule 1.
* **Relief Granted:** The court did not grant any specific relief.
* **Orders:** The court ordered that the question of law was decided as stated above. It also recommended that the Bombay High Court revise its Original Side Rules to align them with the Commercial Courts Act, like the Delhi High Court had done.

## 7. Implications

* **Impact on Law:** This judgment reaffirms the mandatory nature of the Commercial Courts Act's amendments to the CPC, specifically regarding the timeframe for filing written statements. It also clarifies the supremacy of the Commercial Courts Act over the Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules in the case of conflict.
* **Future Relevance:** This case will be relevant for future cases involving Commercial Suits before the Bombay High Court and other High Courts, providing guidance on the application of the Commercial Courts Act and the interpretation of the relevant provisions. It will also likely impact the ongoing efforts to harmonize the Original Side Rules of various High Courts with the Commercial Courts Act.
* **Broader Context:** The judgment contributes to the broader movement towards a more streamlined and efficient legal system for commercial disputes in India. It highlights the importance of enforcing timelines and adhering to legislative mandates in order to expedite justice.

## 8. Summary Points

* The Commercial Courts Act, 2015, with its amendments, mandates a 120-day timeframe for Defendants to file written statements in Commercial Suits.
* The Bombay High Court's Commercial Division is bound to follow this mandatory provision, even though it may have different rules under its Original Side Rules.
* The Court cannot use Order VIII Rule 9 to condone the delay, as doing so would defeat the purpose of the Commercial Courts Act.
* Equity cannot be invoked to override the clear legislative mandate.
* The Bombay High Court should consider revising its Original Side Rules to align them with the Commercial Courts Act.
