    * Cause of Action: The set of facts that give rise to a legal claim.

**4. Arguments Presented**

* **Plaintiff's Argument:**
    * The Respondent's use of the "Vimal" name was deceptively similar to the Appellants' established brand, leading to passing off.
    * The Court at Ahmedabad had jurisdiction because the Respondent's goods were being sold within its jurisdiction, as evidenced by the invoices produced.
    * Section 134 of the Trade Marks Act could apply, even though the "Vimal" mark was not registered, as it was the subject of a passing off claim.
* **Defendant's Argument:**
    * The Appellants failed to establish a genuine cause of action within the jurisdiction of the Court.
    * The invoices produced by the Appellants were forged and fabricated; they did not prove the Respondent was selling goods in Ahmedabad.
    * Section 134 of the Trade Marks Act was not applicable as the suit was solely based on passing off, which is governed by common law.
    * The Appellant's suit should be filed in Bardoli, where the Respondent had its registered office and main business operations.

**5. Court's Analysis and Reasoning**

* **Key Findings:**
    * The Court found that the invoices relied upon by the Appellants were not genuine, lacking credible evidence to support their claim of the Respondent's goods being sold in Ahmedabad.
    * The Court held that the Appellants failed to implead the alleged vendors (Alka Stores and Shree Krushna Dudh Ghar) as defendants, despite being given ample opportunity.
    * While the Appellants argued for jurisdiction based on passing off, the Court determined that Section 134 of the Trade Marks Act was not applicable as the "Vimal" mark was not registered.
    * The Court emphasized that mere averments in the plaint, without supporting evidence, were insufficient to establish territorial jurisdiction.
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The Court meticulously examined Section 20 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which dictates that a suit must be filed in the Court where the defendant resides or carries on business.
    * The Court analyzed the requirements of Section 134 of the Trade Marks Act, which deals with suits for infringement and passing off related to registered trade marks.
    * The Court relied on various precedents to determine the relevant legal principles regarding territorial jurisdiction, passing off, and cause of action.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The Court applied the established principles of territorial jurisdiction to the facts of the case, considering the location of the Respondent's business and registered office, and the evidence provided regarding the sale of goods.
    * The Court concluded that the Appellants failed to prove a genuine cause of action within the jurisdiction of the Court at Ahmedabad.

**6. Judgment**

* **Final Decision:** The Appeal From Order filed by the Appellants was dismissed.
* **Relief Granted:** No relief was granted to the Appellants.
* **Orders:** The Court ordered the return of the plaint to the Appellants to be presented before the appropriate court with jurisdiction.

**7. Implications**

* **Impact on Law:** This judgment reinforces the importance of establishing a genuine cause of action and providing substantial evidence to support the claim of territorial jurisdiction. It highlights the careful scrutiny courts apply to invoices or other documents used to assert jurisdiction.
* **Future Relevance:** This case serves as a precedent for future cases involving passing off and territorial jurisdiction, particularly where the relevant trade mark is not registered.
* **Broader Context:** The case underscores the significance of proper pleading and supporting evidence in litigation, emphasizing the need for a robust and clear legal framework to determine territorial jurisdiction in commercial disputes.
