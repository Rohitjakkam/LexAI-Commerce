## 2. Background and Context

• **Brief Overview:** The Moradabad Development Authority (MDA) entered into a contract with M/S V.R.

VRCE was supposed to complete the project within two years (by 02.03.2011) but faced delays, resulting in extensions granted by the MDA.

    - Whether the MDA was justified in cancelling the appointment of the sole Arbitrator and declaring the contract null and void.

• **Appellant’s Argument (MDA):**
    - VRCE submitted a forged experience certificate to secure the contract.
    - VRCE committed irregularities in executing the contract.
    - Cancellation of the Arbitrator's appointment was valid because the contract was based on a forged document.
    - The Arbitrator's award was pronounced without jurisdiction after his appointment was cancelled.
    - The MDA's application to set aside the award should be allowed under Section 14 of the Limitation Act, as the MDA pursued other remedies in good faith.
• **Respondent’s Argument (VRCE):**
    - The MDA's actions were unjustified, and the contract remained valid.
    - The MDA's cancellation of the Arbitrator's appointment was invalid.
    - The Arbitrator's award was valid and should be enforced.
    - The MDA's application to set aside the award was time-barred and Section 14 of the Limitation Act was not applicable.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

• **Key Findings:**
    - The MDA did not challenge the cancellation of the Arbitrator's appointment before any court, and the order had attained finality.
    - The Arbitrator's award was made after the MDA cancelled his appointment, but the award did not specifically mention the date of cancellation.
    - The MDA pursued remedies against the award through an FIR and objections under Section 47 CPC, but these actions were not considered valid civil proceedings for the purposes of Section 14 of the Limitation Act.
• **Interpretation of Law:**
    - The court interpreted Section 34(3) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, and its proviso, to hold that the time limit for filing an application to set aside an award was three months, which could be extended by an additional 30 days, but no further.
    - The court interpreted Section 14 of the Limitation Act, holding that it would apply to arbitral proceedings under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act.
• **Application of Law:**
    - The court applied the principles of Section 14 of the Limitation Act and found that the MDA did not fulfill the conditions necessary for excluding the period spent pursuing other remedies.

## 6. Judgment

• **Final Decision:** The appeal was dismissed.
• **Relief Granted:** None.
• **Orders:**  The order of the Commercial Court, Moradabad dated 05.03.2020, refusing to condone the delay in making the application by the appellant under Section 34(2) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, was upheld.

## 7. Implications

• **Impact on Law:** The judgment reinforces the principles of limitation under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act and the applicability of Section 14 of the Limitation Act to arbitral proceedings.
• **Future Relevance:** This case provides guidance on how courts will interpret the limitation periods and the application of Section 14 in cases involving arbitral awards.
• **Broader Context:** The case highlights the importance of timely legal action and the consequences of failing to properly challenge legal proceedings within the prescribed time limits.
