## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Appellant's Argument:**
    * The District Judge (Commercial Court) erred in awarding licence fee and interest to Respondent No.1 because it could not rewrite the contract under Section 34 of the Act, 1996.
    * The District Judge (Commercial Court) misinterpreted the Arbitrator's findings on the availability of space.
    * The Award was not severable, and the partial setting aside was incorrect.
* **Respondent No. 1's Argument:**
    * The Arbitrator's findings were based on no evidence and were severable, making the partial setting aside justifiable.
    * The District Judge (Commercial Court) correctly determined that the Appellant was liable to pay licence fees.

## 5. Court's Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The Court found that the District Judge (Commercial Court) acted as an appellate court and re-appreciated evidence instead of limiting its role to challenging the Arbitrator's Award on the grounds stipulated in Section 34 of the Act, 1996.
    * The Court determined that the Arbitrator's Award was not severable as the issue of licence fee was intertwined with the validity of the Licence Agreement, making partial setting aside of the Award inappropriate.
    * The Court held that the District Judge (Commercial Court) had no power to modify the Award under Section 34 of the Act, 1996.
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The Court reiterated the limited scope of judicial interference in arbitration under Section 34 of the Act, 1996.
    * The Court interpreted precedents to confirm that courts can only set aside Awards on specific grounds and cannot rewrite or modify them.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The Court applied the principles of patent illegality, fundamental policy, and severability to the facts of the case. 
    * The Court found that the Arbitrator's Award did not violate any legal principles, and the District Judge (Commercial Court) exceeded its jurisdiction.

## 6. Judgment

* **Final Decision:** The Appeal was allowed, and the Order of the District Judge (Commercial Court) was set aside. 
* **Relief Granted:** The Arbitral Award dated 21.12.2018 was upheld in its entirety.
* **Orders:** The Delhi High Court ordered fresh arbitration proceedings to be initiated if the parties wished to pursue the dispute further.

## 7. Implications

* **Impact on Law:** The judgment reaffirms the principle of limited judicial review in arbitration proceedings under Section 34 of the Act, 1996. It reinforces the principle that courts cannot modify or rewrite Arbitral Awards.
* **Future Relevance:** This judgment will likely be cited in future cases where the scope of judicial intervention in arbitration is in question. 
* **Broader Context:** The case highlights the importance of parties understanding the limitations of judicial intervention in arbitration and ensuring that the Arbitral process is conducted fairly and with proper reasoning.

## 8. Summary Points

* The Delhi High Court upheld the Arbitral Award, finding that the District Judge (Commercial Court) had exceeded its jurisdiction by re-interpreting evidence and modifying the Award. 
* The Court confirmed that courts can only set aside Awards on the grounds specified in Section 34 of the Act, 1996, and cannot rewrite or modify them.
* The case serves as a reminder that arbitration is intended to be a faster and more efficient method of dispute resolution than traditional litigation, and courts should exercise caution when intervening in the Arbitral process.
