The court also recognized that the Act intended to provide speedy adjudication of commercial disputes.
* **Application of Law:** The court applied the provisions of Section 10(3) of the Commercial Courts Act, which granted jurisdiction for arbitration matters to Commercial Courts, to the case at hand.
