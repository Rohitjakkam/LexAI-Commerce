## 1. Case Title

* **Case Name:** Gujarat Jhm Hotels Ltd vs. Rajasthali Resorts And Studios Limited
* **Court:** Delhi High Court
* **Date of Judgment:** 17 January 2023
* **Citation:** 2023/DHC/000323

## 2. Background and Context

* **Brief Overview:** This case involves a dispute arising out of a Hotel Management Agreement (HMA) between Gujarat Jhm Hotels Ltd (petitioner/decree holder) and Rajasthali Resorts And Studios Limited (respondent/judgment debtor). Following disputes, the petitioner invoked arbitration, and an award was rendered on 26 May 2017 in favor of the petitioner. The respondent challenged the award before the Delhi High Court (Section 34 petition) and also sought various interim reliefs against the respondent (Section 9 petition).  The petitioner sought execution of the award in the Commercial Court at Jaipur, Rajasthan, but proceedings were adjourned sine die due to a pending appeal in a similar case regarding the jurisdiction to execute awards. 
* **Key Issues:** The case raised a key issue about the correct jurisdiction for executing arbitral awards in India, particularly regarding the conflict between the Supreme Court's judgments in Associated Contractors and Sundaram Finance. Specifically:
    * Which court has jurisdiction to execute an arbitral award: the court where the arbitration took place (seat court) or the court where the judgment debtor's assets are located?
    * Does the seat of arbitration establish an exclusive jurisdiction clause, limiting execution to the seat court?
    * How do the provisions of Section 36 and Section 42 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, interact with the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (CPC) regarding execution of decrees?

## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Plaintiff’s Argument:**
    * The petitioner argued that the adjournment sine die of the execution petition in the Jaipur Commercial Court left them with no remedy.
    * They contended that the uncertainty of the pending appeal regarding the jurisdiction to execute awards made it necessary to approach the Delhi High Court.
    * The petitioner argued that the Supreme Court's judgments in Associated Contractors and Sundaram Finance do not conflict, as they both acknowledge the option of initiating execution proceedings before the court where the judgment debtor's assets are located.
* **Defendant’s Argument:**
    * The respondent argued for a definitive clarification of the legal position regarding the jurisdiction to execute arbitral awards.
    * They highlighted the potential conflict between the Supreme Court's decisions in Associated Contractors and Sundaram Finance, and the need to reconcile these judgments.
    * The respondent contended that the decision in Sundaram Finance, which did not consider the judgment in Associated Contractors, might not fully represent the correct legal position.
    * The respondent also brought up the Supreme Court's judgment in Hardy Exploration, arguing that it could be interpreted as conflicting with Sundaram Finance. 

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The Court recognized that the seat of arbitration holds significant importance in modern arbitration proceedings, as established by the Supreme Court in BGS Soma. 
    * The Court concluded that the Supreme Court's decisions in Associated Contractors and Sundaram Finance do not create irreconcilable conflicts.
    * The Court emphasized that while the seat court is the primary forum for all challenges relating to the arbitration agreement and award, the decree holder is not restricted to initiating execution proceedings solely before the seat court.
    * The Court observed that Sundaram Finance allows the decree holder to choose between initiating execution proceedings before the seat court or directly approaching the court where the judgment debtor or its assets are located.
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The Court interpreted the Supreme Court's decisions in BGS Soma and Sundaram Finance as recognizing the principles of party autonomy, the significance of the seat of arbitration, and the flexibility in choosing the forum for execution proceedings. 
    * The Court interpreted Section 42 of the Act as applying to all applications made before, during, or after arbitral proceedings, including those related to the execution of awards.
    * The Court acknowledged the limited nature of the "deeming fiction" in Section 36, which treats an award as a decree only for the purpose of execution.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The Court applied the principles from BGS Soma to determine that the seat court (Delhi High Court in this case) would have jurisdiction over all challenges relating to the arbitration agreement and award.
    * However, applying the principles from Sundaram Finance, the Court held that the petitioner could choose to initiate execution proceedings in the Jaipur Commercial Court, where the respondent's assets were located.
    * The Court recognized that the Jaipur Commercial Court had already adjourned the execution proceedings sine die pending the resolution of the jurisdictional issue.

## 6. Judgment

* **Final Decision:**  The Delhi High Court recognized the jurisdiction of the Jaipur Commercial Court to execute the award. 
* **Relief Granted:** The Court granted a certificate of transfer, allowing the petitioner to re-initiate execution proceedings in the Jaipur Commercial Court. 
* **Orders:** The Delhi High Court ordered the transfer of the award to the Jaipur Commercial Court for enforcement and execution as a decree.

## 7. Implications

* **Impact on Law:** This decision reaffirms the flexibility provided by Sundaram Finance regarding the jurisdiction to execute arbitral awards. The court emphasizes that the decree holder can choose to initiate execution proceedings directly before the court where the judgment debtor's assets are located, without needing to first approach the seat court.
* **Future Relevance:** The case provides valuable guidance for parties in similar situations, highlighting the option of choosing the most efficient forum for execution proceedings. The court's interpretation of Sundaram Finance strengthens the ability of parties to choose a convenient and efficient venue for enforcing arbitral awards.
* **Broader Context:** The judgment highlights the evolving approach of Indian courts towards arbitral proceedings, emphasizing party autonomy and minimizing procedural burdens. This decision encourages a more practical and efficient method of resolving disputes through arbitration. 

## 8. Summary Points

* The Delhi High Court upheld the right of the decree holder to initiate execution proceedings directly in the court where the judgment debtor's assets are located, even if the arbitration took place elsewhere. 
* This decision clarifies the interpretation of Sundaram Finance and distinguishes it from the decision in Associated Contractors.
* The Court's judgment emphasizes the importance of party autonomy and efficiency in arbitration proceedings.
