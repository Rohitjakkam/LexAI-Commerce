## Arguments Presented

* **Plaintiff’s Argument:**
    * The invoice terms (specifying Pardi jurisdiction) superseded the purchase order terms, creating jurisdiction for the Vapi (and later the Vadodara) Court.
    * Section 20 of the CPC granted jurisdiction to the Vapi Court as the plaintiff's factory was located within its territorial limits.
    * The defendant accepted the goods despite the invoice terms, implying agreement to the Pardi jurisdiction.
    * Order 7 Rule 10 of the CPC did not allow the Indian court to return the plaint to a foreign court.
* **Defendant’s Argument:**
    * The purchase order constituted the entire contract, including the exclusive jurisdiction clause for the Indiana Court.
    * The plaintiff did not accept any changes in writing to the purchase order terms, making the invoice clause regarding Pardi jurisdiction unenforceable.
    * The defendant first initiated proceedings against the plaintiff in the Indiana Court, indicating agreement to the exclusive jurisdiction clause.
    * Order 7 Rule 10 permitted returning the plaint to a foreign court if it had jurisdiction as per the agreement.

## Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The purchase order clearly stated that it was the sole agreement between the parties and any changes needed to be accepted in writing.
    * The defendant did not accept the invoice terms specifying Pardi jurisdiction in writing.
    * The purchase order contained a specific clause for exclusive jurisdiction in Indiana and the parties waived any right to challenge venue.
    * The defendant had filed the initial suit in the Indiana Court, indicating agreement with the exclusive jurisdiction clause.
    * The Court could return the plaint to a foreign court having jurisdiction under Order 7 Rule 10, regardless of whether it was a foreign or domestic court.
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The Court strictly interpreted the contractual terms, finding the purchase order to be the primary contract and the invoice clauses subordinate and unenforceable without written acceptance.
    * The Court interpreted Order 7 Rule 10 as allowing the return of a plaint to any court having jurisdiction, including a foreign court.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The Court applied the principles of contract interpretation and found the Indiana Court to have exclusive jurisdiction based on the purchase order agreement.
    * The Court applied Order 7 Rule 10, returning the plaint to the plaintiff to be presented before the Indiana Court, as it was the court with agreed jurisdiction.

## Judgment

* **Final Decision:** The Appeal From Order was dismissed.
* **Relief Granted:** No relief was granted.
* **Orders:** The impugned order of the Commercial Court was upheld. The Civil Application No.1/2017 was also dismissed. 

## Implications

* **Impact on Law:** This case reinforces the importance of clear and unambiguous contractual clauses specifying exclusive jurisdiction, particularly when dealing with international transactions. 
* **Future Relevance:** This case can be cited as precedent in future disputes regarding jurisdiction and contract interpretation, particularly where a purchase order sets out the entire agreement between parties and contains a specific clause designating jurisdiction.
* **Broader Context:** The case highlights the challenges and complexities of enforcing contractual terms in international commercial disputes, especially when there are discrepancies between the initial agreement (purchase order) and subsequent documents (invoices). 

## Summary Points

* The Court upheld the Commercial Court's decision to return the plaint to the plaintiff.
* The Court found that the purchase order constituted the entire contract and the Indiana Court had exclusive jurisdiction, despite the invoice specifying Pardi jurisdiction.
* The Court interpreted Order 7 Rule 10 to allow the return of a plaint to a foreign court having jurisdiction under the agreement.
