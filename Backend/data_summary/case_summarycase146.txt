* **Date of Judgment:** 22nd September 2023
* **Citation:** 2023:AHC:184463-DB

## 2. Background and Context

* **Brief Overview:** This case arose from a contract between Hindustan Steelworks Construction Limited (HSCL), a Government of India undertaking, and the New Okhla Industrial Development Authority (NOIDA) for the construction of two flyovers in Gautam Budh Nagar. After the work commenced, NOIDA suspected inflated contract costs and suspended the work for 928 days. HSCL, facing financial distress, agreed to complete the project at the original cost without claiming compensation for the suspension period. However, after completing the project, HSCL claimed damages for the suspension period and price escalation, leading to arbitration. 
* **Key Issues:**
    * Whether the Supplementary Memorandum of Understanding (Supplementary MoU) signed by HSCL was vitiated by coercion, duress, or undue influence.
    * Whether HSCL was entitled to damages under Clause 13(ii)(b) of the General Conditions of Contract (GCC) for the suspension period despite agreeing to waive such claims in the Supplementary MoU.
    * Whether the Court could partially set aside the arbitral award while upholding the remaining portion of the award.

## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Appellant's Argument:** 
    * HSCL argued that the Supplementary MoU was obtained under duress, coercion, and undue influence from NOIDA. 
    * They argued that NOIDA was in a dominant position and used its power to force HSCL to waive its right to claim damages for the suspension period.
    * HSCL argued that they were under financial distress due to the suspension and had no other choice but to agree to the terms. 
    * They asserted that the Supplementary MoU did not override or amend Clause 13(ii)(b) of the GCC, which entitled them to damages for the suspension period.
    * HSCL argued that the Court had the power to partially set aside the award by separating the claim for damages from other valid claims. 
* **Respondent's Argument:** 
    * NOIDA argued that HSCL voluntarily agreed to complete the project at the original cost without compensation for the suspension period. 
    * They presented HSCL's letters dated 29.04.2005 and 10.05.2005, where HSCL explicitly agreed to forgo compensation and price escalation.
    * NOIDA argued that HSCL, being a Government of India undertaking, had access to independent legal advice and could have chosen to treat the suspension as a foreclosure of the contract.
    * NOIDA contended that HSCL raised the plea of coercion and undue influence as an afterthought to unjustly enrich themselves at the cost of the public exchequer.
    * They argued that the Court did not have the power to partially set aside the award and that setting aside the claim for damages would necessitate setting aside the entire award.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The Court found that the suspension of work was due to reasons attributable to NOIDA.
    * The Court found that HSCL did not protest or take any steps to avoid the Supplementary MoU at the time of its execution.
    * The Court found that HSCL had the option to treat the suspension as a foreclosure of the contract under Clause 11 of the GCC but chose not to exercise this option.
    * The Court found that HSCL raised the claim for damages for the suspension period as an afterthought and that there was no evidence of coercion or undue influence in the execution of the Supplementary MoU.
    * The Court found that the doctrine of severability applies to arbitral awards under Section 34 of the ACA.
* **Interpretation of Law:** 
    * The Court interpreted Section 34 of the ACA, which outlines the grounds for setting aside arbitral awards, and clarified the scope of "public policy of India."
    * The Court reviewed various precedents related to economic duress, unequal bargaining power, and the concept of "legitimate pressure" in commercial transactions.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The Court applied the principles of economic duress and unequal bargaining power to the facts of the case, finding that HSCL had not proven their claim of coercion.
    * The Court determined that the Supplementary MoU superseded Clause 13(ii)(b) of the GCC, precluding HSCL from claiming damages for the suspension period.
    * The Court applied the doctrine of severability, allowing it to set aside the claim for damages while upholding the remaining portion of the award.

## 6. Judgment

* **Final Decision:** The appeal was allowed in part. The Court upheld the arbitral award regarding price variation but set aside the award for damages related to the suspension period.
* **Relief Granted:** The Court upheld the award of Rs. 23.94 crores for price variation but set aside the award of Rs. 35.92 crores for damages, along with the related interest.

* **Future Relevance:**  This case provides guidance on how courts should assess claims of economic duress and unequal bargaining power in commercial contracts. It emphasizes the importance of protest and other actions demonstrating a lack of free will in accepting a contractual agreement.
* **Broader Context:** This case highlights the potential tension between upholding the principle of contract sanctity and protecting parties from unfair or coerced agreements in commercial transactions. It also underscores the need for parties to clearly document their understanding and intentions regarding contractual terms.
