## 1. Case Title

* **Date of Judgment:** 27th February, 2019
* **Citation:**  (Not provided in the text, but the case number is COMS No. 316 of 2018)

## 2. Background and Context

* **Brief Overview:** This case arose from multiple commercial suits filed before the Bombay High Court's Commercial Division. Various defendants failed to file their written statements within the 120-day time limit stipulated by the Commercial Courts Act, 2015. This led to the defendants filing motions seeking condonation of delay, which the plaintiffs opposed. The Bombay High Court, to settle the controversy, framed a question of law regarding the enforceability of the 120-day deadline. 
* **Key Issues:**
    * Whether the 120-day time limit for filing a written statement in commercial suits, as amended by the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, is mandatory or directory.
    * Whether the Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules override the amended provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC) as introduced by the Commercial Courts Act.
    * Whether the court retains discretion under Order VIII Rules 9 and 10 of the CPC to take on record a written statement even after the 120-day deadline.

## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Plaintiff’s Argument:**
    * The Commercial Courts Act was enacted to expedite the resolution of commercial disputes, and the 120-day deadline is mandatory to achieve this goal.
    * The amended provisions of the CPC, as introduced by the Commercial Courts Act, override conflicting provisions in the Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules.
    * The court's discretion to take on record written statements under Order VIII Rules 9 and 10 has been circumscribed by the Commercial Courts Act, specifically by the added proviso to Order VIII Rule 10.
    * The court should interpret the CPC harmoniously with the intent and purpose of the Commercial Courts Act.
    * Reliance on past cases, such as Shailaja and Chintaman, is misplaced as they were decided before the amendments introduced by the Commercial Courts Act.
* **Defendant’s Argument:**
    * The Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules, as a special law, override the amended provisions of the CPC, giving the court the power to condone delay.
    * The court retains discretion under Order VIII Rules 9 and 10 to take on record written statements even after the 120-day deadline.
    * The court should consider equitable considerations and not rigidly follow the time limit.
    * The language of Order VIII Rule 9 suggests that the court can request "a" written statement, distinct from "the" written statement mentioned in Order VIII Rule 1 and 10, even after the deadline.
    * The 120-day deadline is directory, and the court has the inherent power under Section 151 of the CPC to condone delay in exceptional circumstances. 

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The Commercial Courts Act is a special Act, and its provisions prevail over conflicting provisions in other special Acts, including the Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules.
    * The 120-day time limit for filing a written statement in commercial suits is mandatory, not directory. 
    * The court's discretion under Order VIII Rules 9 and 10 has been limited by the Commercial Courts Act, and the court cannot take on record a written statement after the 120-day deadline.
    *  The court is bound by legislative mandate, and equitable considerations cannot override the law. 
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The court interpreted the "Rule of the jurisdictional High Court" in Section 16(3) of the Commercial Courts Act to include the Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules.
    * The court held that the "Mischief Rule" of statutory interpretation supports a mandatory interpretation of the 120-day deadline, as it aims to address the problem of delays in commercial disputes. 
    * The court relied on the Apex Court's decision in M/s SCG Contracts India Pvt. Ltd. Vs. K.S. Chamankar Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. to reaffirm the mandatory nature of the 120-day deadline. 
    * The court distinguished past cases, such as Shailaja and Chintaman, because they were decided before the amendments introduced by the Commercial Courts Act.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The court applied the principle of harmonious construction to interpret the provisions of the Commercial Courts Act and the CPC.
    * The court applied the principle of "dura lex sed lex" to uphold the mandatory nature of the 120-day deadline, even though it might result in hardship in some cases.

## 6. Judgment

* **Final Decision:** The court decided that the 120-day time limit for filing a written statement in commercial suits is mandatory, and a written statement cannot be taken on record after that deadline.
* **Relief Granted:** No specific relief was granted as the judgment was in the form of an order resolving a question of law.
* **Orders:** 
    * The court ordered that the 120-day deadline is mandatory.
    * The court recommended that the Bombay High Court should revise its Original Side Rules to align with the Commercial Courts Act. 
    * The court emphasized the need for strict timelines for both plaintiffs and defendants in commercial suits to expedite the disposal of cases.

## 7. Implications

* **Impact on Law:** This judgment clarifies the mandatory nature of the 120-day deadline for filing written statements in commercial suits. It establishes that the Commercial Courts Act overrides conflicting provisions in other special Acts, including the Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules. 
* **Future Relevance:** This case sets a precedent for the interpretation of the Commercial Courts Act and the application of the 120-day deadline. 
* **Broader Context:** The judgment highlights the legislative intent to expedite commercial dispute resolution in India and create a more efficient and predictable legal system. It encourages a more streamlined approach to commercial litigation.

## 8. Summary Points

* The 120-day deadline for filing a written statement in commercial suits is mandatory, not directory.
