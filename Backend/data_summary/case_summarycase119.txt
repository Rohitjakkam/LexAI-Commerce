## 4. Arguments Presented

###  Plaintiff’s Argument:

* The Commercial Courts Act was enacted to address the issue of delays in commercial litigation and provide a streamlined mechanism for resolving disputes.
* The mandatory language of the amended Order VIII Rule 1 clearly indicates the legislative intent to impose a strict 120-day deadline for filing written statements.
* The provisions of the Commercial Courts Act override conflicting rules of the Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules, 1980, as evidenced by Sections 16 and 21 of the Act.
* The wide interpretation of Order VIII Rule 9 advocated by the defendants would render the amendments in the Commercial Courts Act meaningless and contradict its purpose.
*  The Delhi High Court's consistent interpretation of the Commercial Courts Act, affirmed by the Supreme Court, establishes a precedent against accepting written statements beyond the 120-day limit.

### Defendant’s Argument:

* The Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules, 1980, are a special law and, under the *Iridium* judgment, prevail over the CPC in original suits.
*  Section 16 of the Commercial Courts Act, when interpreted in light of the definition of "rules" under the CPC, does not apply to the Bombay High Court's Original Side Rules.
* The court retains discretion under Order VIII Rule 9 to call for a written statement at any time, even after the 120-day limit, as this provision is directory and not mandatory.
* The court can exercise its inherent powers under Section 151 of the CPC to address exceptional circumstances where a rigid interpretation of the 120-day deadline would lead to injustice.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The court recognized the paramount intent of the legislature in enacting the Commercial Courts Act to expedite commercial litigation and reduce delays.
    * The court acknowledged the mandatory nature of the amendments introduced to Order VIII Rule 1 by the Commercial Courts Act.
    * The court accepted the distinction between the 2002 amendment to the CPC and the Commercial Courts Act, recognizing the latter's specific intent to override conflicting provisions.
    *  The court held that the *Iridium* judgment does not apply in this case because it involved a conflict between a general act and a special act, while this case involves a conflict between two special acts.
    * The court interpreted the word "Rule" in Section 16(3) of the Commercial Courts Act to include the Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules, finding that the act intended to override any conflicting rule of the jurisdictional high court.
    * The court ruled that the proviso to Order VIII Rule 10, which bars extending the time to file written statements beyond 120 days, specifically relates to Order VIII Rule 1 and does not limit the court's discretion under Order VIII Rule 9. 
    * The court found that the defendants' interpretation of Order VIII Rule 9 would render the 120-day limit in the Commercial Courts Act meaningless and result in a situation where commercial suits would be treated no differently than non-commercial suits.
    * The court acknowledged that the court retains discretion under Order VIII Rule 9 to call for a written statement, but only in exceptional circumstances and for reasons recorded in writing.
    *  The court concluded that considerations of equity cannot override clear statutory provisions, citing various precedents where the court upheld the principle of "dura lex sed lex."
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The court emphasized the legislative intent behind the Commercial Courts Act to create a system for the expeditious disposal of commercial disputes, and interpreted the amendments to Order VIII Rule 1 and other provisions accordingly.
    * The court interpreted the "non obstante" clause in Section 21 of the Commercial Courts Act as clearly indicating the legislature's intention to override any inconsistent provisions of other laws.
    * The court distinguished the *Iridium* judgment, finding that its ratio does not apply when dealing with a conflict between two special acts, as in this case.
    * The court interpreted the word "Rule" in Section 16(3) of the Commercial Courts Act to include the Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The court applied the rule of "generalia specialibus non derogant" to conclude that the provisions of the Commercial Courts Act, being a special law, would override the general provisions of Order VIII Rule 9 in commercial suits.
    *  The court applied the principle of "dura lex sed lex" to reject the defendants' arguments based on equity and fairness, emphasizing that the court must follow the law as written, even if it leads to harsh consequences.

## 6. Judgment

* **Final Decision:**  The court held that the amended Order VIII Rule 1, introduced by the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, is mandatory in nature and that a written statement cannot be taken on record after the expiry of 120 days from the date of service of the Writ of Summons in Commercial Suits.
* **Relief Granted:** No specific relief was granted in this Order as it was focused on deciding the question of law.
* **Orders:** The court ordered that the Commercial Division of the Bombay High Court must adhere to the provisions of the Commercial Courts Act in its entirety while adjudicating Commercial Suits. The court also recommended that the High Court revise its Original Side Rules to harmonize them with the Commercial Courts Act.

## 7. Implications

* **Impact on Law:** This judgment clarifies the mandatory nature of the amended Order VIII Rule 1 introduced by the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, and its application to commercial suits. It further clarifies that the provisions of the Commercial Courts Act override conflicting provisions of the Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules.
* **Future Relevance:** This case will likely serve as a precedent for other courts interpreting the Commercial Courts Act and its amendments to the CPC. It will also likely influence future decisions on the interplay between special laws and general laws.
* **Broader Context:** This case highlights the increasing importance of ensuring the efficient and expeditious disposal of commercial disputes in India, a crucial aspect of attracting investment and promoting economic growth.

## 8. Summary Points

* The Commercial Courts Act's amendments to the CPC are mandatory, not directory, and impose a strict 120-day deadline for filing written statements in commercial suits.
* The Commercial Courts Act overrides conflicting provisions of the Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules.
* The court retains discretion under Order VIII Rule 9 to call for a written statement beyond the 120-day limit, but only in exceptional circumstances and for reasons recorded in writing.
* Courts cannot bend the law on equitable grounds. "Dura lex sed lex" applies.
* To ensure uniformity in the application of the Commercial Courts Act, the Bombay High Court should revise its Original Side Rules to harmonize them with the Act.
