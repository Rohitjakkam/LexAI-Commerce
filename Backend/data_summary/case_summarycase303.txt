## Background and Context

* **Brief Overview:** The case involved a dispute between The New India Assurance Company Limited (Appellant) and Alps Chemicals Private Limited (Respondent) regarding an arbitral award. The Respondent had filed various claims against the Appellant and a retired judge of the Gujarat High Court was appointed as Sole Arbitrator.

The Appellant then filed an appeal under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (Act, 1996) seeking to set aside the award. The Appellant also filed an application for condonation of delay, as the appeal was filed 51 days late. 
* **Key Issues:** The main issue in the case was whether the Gujarat High Court had the power to condone the delay in filing an application challenging the award under Section 34 of the Act, 1996, after the prescribed time limit of 3 months and 30 days had passed.

## Arguments Presented

* **Appellant’s Argument:**
    * The Appellant argued that the actual delay in filing the appeal was 21 days, not 51 days, as the limitation period should commence from the date of receiving the arbitral award (19 September 2018), not earlier.
    * The Appellant claimed that the delay was caused due to circumstances such as consulting with a Chartered Accountant, obtaining legal advice, and seeking approval from higher authorities.
    * The Appellant emphasized the need to consider the objectives of the Act, 1996, which aim for expedited resolution of disputes and should not be hampered by technicalities.
    * The Appellant cited several judgments, particularly Benarsi Krishna Committee (2012) and Bihar Rajya Bhumi Vikas Bank Samiti (2018), to support their contention that the court should condone the delay.
* **Respondent’s Argument:**
    * The Respondent argued that even if the delay was only 21 days, the Appellant had still failed to file the appeal within the extended period of 30 days provided by Section 34(3) of the Act, 1996.
    * The Respondent emphasized the phrase "but not thereafter" in Section 34(3), arguing that it explicitly excludes the application of Section 5 of the Limitation Act and therefore, the Court cannot condone any delay exceeding the 30-day extension.
    * The Respondent cited several judgments, including Popular Construction Company (2001), Simplex Infrastructure Limited (2019), and various others, to support their claim that the Court lacked the power to condone the delay.

## Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

    * The Court recognized the importance of Section 34(3) of the Act, 1996, which clearly sets a limitation period for challenging arbitral awards and provides a limited extension for sufficient cause. 
    * The Court highlighted the phrase "but not thereafter" as an express exclusion of the Limitation Act's applicability to the Act, 1996. 
    * The Court reviewed the precedents cited by both parties and found consistent rulings from the Supreme Court that the Court cannot condone delay beyond the 30-day extension specified in Section 34(3).
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The Court meticulously analyzed the language of Section 34(3) of the Act, 1996, emphasizing the significance of the phrase "but not thereafter" as an express exclusion of the applicability of Section 5 of the Limitation Act.
    * The Court interpreted the language of the Act, 1996, in conjunction with relevant case laws to determine the scope and limitations of condoning delay. 
* **Application of Law:**
