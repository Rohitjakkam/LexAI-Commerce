MSC had filed a lawsuit in the High Court of Justice, Queen's Bench Decision (Commercial Court) in London, where a summary judgment was passed in their favor.

## Arguments Presented

**Plaintiff’s Argument (Oren):**

* The London Court lacked jurisdiction because Oren did not consent to the jurisdiction clause in the Bill of Lading, which MSC claimed conferred exclusive jurisdiction on English courts.
* The summary judgment was not passed on the merits of the case, as there were several disputed facts that were not fully examined.
* The judgment was obtained by fraud because MSC suppressed material facts, including the disposal of the cargo and the absence of actual storage or demurrage charges.
* The London judgment was contrary to Indian law and principles of natural justice.

**Defendant’s Argument (MSC):**

* Both parties submitted to the jurisdiction of the London Court by participating in the proceedings.
* The summary judgment was passed on merits after both sides filed pleadings, witness statements, and participated in oral arguments.
* There was no fraud, as all the relevant facts were presented before the London Court.
* The London judgment is binding on Oren, and the Madras High Court should not re-litigate the same issues.

* The court acknowledged that extensive pleadings, witness statements, and oral arguments were presented in the London proceedings.
* The court found no evidence of fraud or suppression of material facts by MSC.
* The court ruled that Oren had the opportunity to appeal the London judgment in England but did not do so.

**Interpretation of Law:**

* The court interpreted Section 13 of the CPC to mean that foreign judgments are generally enforceable in India, but there are exceptions, including when the judgment is obtained by fraud.
* The court applied the doctrine of res judicata, holding that Oren cannot re-litigate the same issues that were already decided by the London Court.

**Application of Law:**

* The court applied the principles of jurisdiction and res judicata to find in favor of MSC.
* The court found that Oren had not proven any of the exceptions to the enforcement of foreign judgments under Section 13 of the CPC.
