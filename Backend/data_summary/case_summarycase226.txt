## 4. Arguments Presented

**Plaintiff’s Argument (Union of India):**

* Parishudh failed to deliver the machine within the stipulated time, despite several extensions, and was in breach of the contract.
* Time was of the essence of the contract, and the Railways had the right to cancel the contract and claim damages for the delay.
* The Arbitral Tribunal erred in awarding compensation to Parishudh without considering the delay and lack of inspection.
* The Arbitral Tribunal was biased in favor of Parishudh by accepting additional documents during final arguments.
* Parishudh was not an MSME and was not entitled to certain benefits under the MSME Act.

**Defendant’s Argument (Parishudh):**

* The Railways was responsible for causing delays by failing to provide timely approvals, drawings, and clarifications.
* The Machine was ready for trial but was awaiting components that the Railways failed to supply.
* The cancellation of the contract was due to a policy change by the Railways, not Parishudh's fault.
* The Arbitral Tribunal correctly interpreted the contract and found that Parishudh was entitled to compensation for its wrongful termination.
* The Arbitral Tribunal was not biased and was appointed by the Railways.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

* The court dismissed the allegations of bias against the Arbitral Tribunal, finding no evidence to support such claims.
* The court upheld the Arbitral Tribunal's finding that Parishudh was entitled to 70% of the value of the machine as compensation for wrongful termination, based on the evidence presented and the valuation report by the Bank.

**Interpretation of Law:**

* The court interpreted the relevant provisions of the Contract Act, the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, and the MSME Act in the context of the specific facts of the case.
* The court relied on several precedents to establish the scope of judicial interference in arbitral awards and the standards for determining bias.
