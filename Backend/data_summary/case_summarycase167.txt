* **Court:** Sikkim High Court
* **Date of Judgment:** 10 May, 2023
* **Citation:** Arbitration Appeal No. 1 of 2020 & Arbitration Appeal No. 1 of 2021

## 2. Background and Context

* **Brief Overview:** The case involves a dispute between Amalgamated Transpower (India) Ltd (ATPL) and Sikkim Power Development Corporation Ltd (SPDC) and the State of Sikkim (SoS) regarding the development of three hydro-electric power projects (HEPs) in Sikkim. ATPL was awarded the projects on a Build Own Operate and Transfer (BOOT) basis in 2002, but the project stalled due to disagreements and delays in land acquisition, access road construction, and other essential aspects. ATPL filed an arbitration claim against SPDC and SoS, seeking specific performance of the 2002 agreement and damages for the project's delay.  The Sole Arbitrator awarded a significant sum in favor of ATPL, but the Commercial Court partially set aside the Award, finding some aspects of it to be patently illegal. Both parties appealed to the Sikkim High Court.
* **Key Issues:**
    * Whether the minutes of meetings held between the parties in 2003-2004 modified the 2002 agreement.
    * Whether ATPL was entitled to specific performance of the agreement despite failing to fulfill essential obligations, like submitting DPRs.
    * Whether ATPL was entitled to damages despite the projects not being built.
    * Whether SoS was justified in terminating the agreement in 2008.

## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Appellant (SPDC & SoS) Argument:**
    * The Sole Arbitrator exceeded his jurisdiction by awarding damages (prayer [D]) even though ATPL sought it only as an alternative to specific performance.
    * The Award (especially prayer [I]) was patently illegal and against public policy due to the huge sum awarded for cost escalation despite no construction activity.
    * The Sole Arbitrator erred in concluding that minutes of meetings modified the 2002 agreement, as it contradicted the explicit requirement of a supplementary agreement under clause 25.
    * ATPL failed to fulfill essential terms of the agreement, like submitting DPRs and taking over the bond liability, making them ineligible for specific performance.
    * SoS was justified in terminating the agreement in 2008 due to ATPL's failure to fulfill essential obligations.
* **Respondent (ATPL) Argument:**
    * The Sole Arbitrator correctly found that the minutes of meetings modified the 2002 agreement, relieving ATPL of certain obligations.
    * The delay in the project was solely attributable to SPDC and SoS's failure to provide land and access roads.
    * ATPL was entitled to both specific performance and damages, as the 2002 agreement was not terminable unilaterally.
    * The Award was not patently illegal, as the Sole Arbitrator considered all arguments and evidence.

## 5. Courtâ€™s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The minutes of the meetings did not amount to a modification of the 2002 agreement, as they were not formal supplementary agreements as stipulated by clause 25.
    * The Sole Arbitrator erred in awarding damages (prayer [D]) alongside specific performance (prayer [A]), violating the principle of election between remedies.
    * The Sole Arbitrator's award of damages (prayer [I]) for cost escalation was excessive and unjustified, shocking the conscience of the Court.
    * ATPL's failure to fulfill essential obligations, like submitting DPRs for all projects and taking over the bond liability, constituted a breach of contract.
    * SoS was justified in terminating the agreement in 2008 due to ATPL's default.
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The Court rigorously analyzed the provisions of the Arbitration Act, the Specific Relief Act, and the Indian Contract Act in relation to the issues at hand.
    * It relied on established precedents to clarify the scope of public policy, patent illegality, and judicial approach in arbitral awards.
    * The Court highlighted the importance of contractual clauses specifying the process for modification and the principle of election between specific performance and damages.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The Court found that the minutes of the meetings did not satisfy the requirements of a supplementary agreement as defined by clause 25, rendering them ineffective in modifying the 2002 agreement.
    * It applied the principle of election, finding that ATPL could not seek damages alongside specific performance, as they were mutually exclusive remedies.
    * It held that ATPL's failure to submit DPRs and take over the bond liability constituted a breach of the contract, justifying SoS's termination of the agreement.

## 6. Judgment

* **Final Decision:** The Court allowed Arbitration Appeal No. 1 of 2020 (SPDC & SoS's appeal) to the extent mentioned above, while dismissing Arbitration Appeal No. 1 of 2021 (ATPL's appeal).
* **Relief Granted:**
    * The Court upheld the setting aside of the Sole Arbitrator's award for damages (prayers [D], [F], [G], and [I]).
    * It upheld the setting aside of the Sole Arbitrator's grant of specific performance, perpetual injunction, and mandatory injunction (prayers [A], [B], and [C]).
    * The Court also set aside the award of interest and costs (prayers [J] and [K]).
    * The Court allowed SPDC and SoS to reclaim the amount deposited with the Supreme Court in a separate case.
* **Orders:**
    * The Court directed the release of the amount deposited by SPDC and SoS to the Supreme Court.
    * The Court left open the possibility for ATPL to claim actual expenses incurred in terms of prayer [F] through fresh arbitration, with SPDC and SoS having the right to file a counter-claim.
