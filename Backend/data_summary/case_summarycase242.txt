## 1. Case Title

* **Case Name:** Bhadreshwar Vidyut Private Limited vs. Godrej Industries Limited
* **Court:** Gujarat High Court
* **Date of Judgment:** 23rd September 2022
* **Citation:** C/FA/4066/2021

## 2. Background and Context

* **Brief Overview:** The case revolves around a dispute between Bhadreshwar Vidyut Private Limited (appellant) and Godrej Industries Limited (respondent) regarding the termination of a power supply agreement. Godrej, needing power for its unit, entered into a 12-year and 1-month Long Term Open Access power supply agreement with Bhadreshwar. This agreement included a bank guarantee for Rs. 3,26,67,840/- provided by Godrej. Godrej later claimed the right to terminate the agreement prematurely based on an amendment to the agreement, citing the establishment of its own captive power plant. Bhadreshwar, however, challenged the termination, claiming it was governed by the agreement's specific termination clause and not the amendment invoked by Godrej. 
* **Key Issues:** 
    * Whether Godrej's termination of the power supply agreement was valid under the agreement.
    * Whether the bank guarantee given by Godrej was unconditional and thus encashable by Bhadreshwar despite the ongoing dispute.
    * Whether the court should grant an injunction restraining Bhadreshwar from encashing the bank guarantee.

## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Appellant's Argument (Bhadreshwar Vidyut Private Limited):**
    * The bank guarantee was unconditional and independent of the power supply agreement. 
    * The bank guarantee could be invoked upon any breach of the power supply agreement, including premature termination, as per the terms of the guarantee.
    * Godrej's termination was invalid as it violated the agreement's termination clause and was based on a misinterpretation of the amendment.
    * The court should not grant an injunction against encashment of the bank guarantee as there was no evidence of fraud, irretrievable injustice, or special equities.
* **Respondent's Argument (Godrej Industries Limited):**
    * The bank guarantee was conditional, only payable upon non-payment of energy bills. 
    * Godrej had terminated the agreement validly under the amended agreement's terms. 
    * Bhadreshwar's claim of transmission charges and compensation was unliquidated and disputed, making it inappropriate to invoke the bank guarantee.
    * Godrej would suffer irretrievable injustice if the injunction was not granted, as Bhadreshwar was financially distressed and might not be able to repay any wrongfully encached amount.
