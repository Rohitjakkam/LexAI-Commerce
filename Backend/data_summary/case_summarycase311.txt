## Arguments Presented

**Plaintiff’s Argument:**

* The Respondent (plaintiff) argued that the dispute was a commercial dispute within the jurisdiction of the Commercial Court. 
* They asserted that the Appellant, a company with a share capital exceeding Rs.2 Crore, was not covered by the Maharashtra Rent Control Act, 1999.
* The Respondent emphasized that the Appellant had failed to pay license fees for several months, leading to significant arrears.
* They claimed that the Appellant's continued occupation of the hotel was illegal and detrimental to the Respondent's financial interests.
* The Respondent argued that the suit was not barred by limitation, as it was for possession and not for a specific injunction.
* They defended the granting of the interim mandatory injunction, stating that it was necessary to protect their rights and prevent further financial loss.

**Defendant’s Argument:**

* The Appellant (defendant) argued that the Commercial Court lacked jurisdiction to hear the case, as the Maharashtra Rent Control Act, 1999, provided for a specific dispute resolution mechanism through a competent authority.
* They claimed that the Respondent was not entitled to equitable relief of injunction due to the delay in filing the suit.
* The Appellant argued that the interim mandatory injunction amounted to granting a final relief at an interim stage, which was inappropriate.
* They claimed that the suit was defective because of the Respondent's failure to comply with the mandatory pre-institution mediation requirement of Section 12-A of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015.
* The Appellant argued that the Respondent's claim was barred by the limitation period under the Limitation Act, 1963.

## Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

**Key Findings:**

* The court found that the Appellant's objection about the Commercial Court's jurisdiction was untenable, as the Appellant had initially accepted the transfer of the suit to the Commercial Court and had contested the case on its merits.
* The court ruled that the provisions of Section 12-A of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, were directory, not mandatory, and that the Appellant had waived their right to raise this objection by not raising it before the trial court. 
* The court found that the Appellant's objection regarding the suit being barred by limitation was misconstrued, as the suit was for possession, not for a specific injunction.
* The court recognized that the Appellant had spent a significant sum on renovations, but also found that the Respondent had paid Rs.1,20,00,000/- towards renovations in advance.
* The court acknowledged that the Appellant had been enjoying the benefits of occupying the hotel, but found that the Respondent was entitled to receive the agreed-upon license fees.

**Interpretation of Law:**

* The court interpreted the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, to establish that the Commercial Court had jurisdiction to hear disputes involving commercial transactions. 
* The court interpreted the Maharashtra Rent Control Act, 1999, to apply only to companies with share capital less than Rs.1 Crore, thus not applicable in this case.
* The court interpreted Section 12-A of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, to be directory, not mandatory, allowing for exceptions based on circumstances.
* The court interpreted the Limitation Act, 1963, to apply differently to suits for possession, requiring a different approach to limitation.
* The court interpreted the concept of interim mandatory injunctions to apply strictly, only in cases where exceptional circumstances justified their use.

**Application of Law:**

* The court applied the principles of jurisdictional challenge to determine that the Appellant could not raise objections regarding the Commercial Court's jurisdiction at an appellate stage.
* The court applied the doctrine of waiver to dismiss the Appellant's argument regarding non-compliance with Section 12-A of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015.
* The court applied the relevant provisions of the Limitation Act, 1963, to determine that the Respondent's suit for possession was not barred by limitation.
* The court applied the principles of interim mandatory injunctions to determine that the granting of the injunction was not appropriate in this case, as it essentially granted a final relief at an interim stage.

## Judgment

**Final Decision:**

* The court modified the Commercial Court's order regarding the interim mandatory injunction.

**Relief Granted:**

* The Appellant was ordered to deposit Rs.4 Crores within six weeks from the date of the order.
* The Appellant was directed to continue paying the regular license fees of Rs.14,25,000/- per month until the final decision of the Commercial Suit.
* The Respondent was entitled to withdraw the amount deposited by the Appellant in the trial court.

**Orders:**

* The court ordered the Appellant to comply with the revised order regarding payment and continued license fees.
* The court ruled that the Respondent could proceed with execution proceedings if the Appellant failed to comply with the court's orders.
* The court did not pass any order regarding the temporary injunction application, allowing it to stand filed.

## Implications

**Impact on Law:**

* The judgment clarifies the scope of jurisdiction of the Commercial Court, affirming its competence to hear commercial disputes, even those potentially related to the Maharashtra Rent Control Act, 1999, under specific circumstances.
* The judgment reaffirms the principle that mandatory pre-institution mediation under Section 12-A of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, is directory, not mandatory, with exceptions based on circumstances.

**Future Relevance:**

* The case sets a precedent for future cases involving similar disputes, highlighting the need for a careful analysis of the specific facts and legal provisions applicable to the dispute.
* The case emphasizes the need for parties to raise jurisdictional objections promptly and to address the requirements of pre-institution mediation at the appropriate stage to avoid potential pitfalls.

**Broader Context:**

* The case highlights the importance of carefully drafting lease agreements and leave and license agreements to avoid potential disputes and to ensure clarity regarding payment obligations and termination provisions.
* The case demonstrates the potential consequences of neglecting payment obligations and the need for parties to take proactive measures to protect their interests and address disputes effectively.

## Summary Points

* The Bombay High Court modified the interim mandatory injunction order of the Commercial Court, requiring the Appellant to pay Rs.4 Crores and continue paying license fees.
* The court emphasized that the Commercial Court had jurisdiction over the commercial dispute, even though the Appellant argued for the applicability of the Maharashtra Rent Control Act, 1999.
