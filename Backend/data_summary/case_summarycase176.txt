## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Appellants' Argument:**
    * The monetary value of the award was substantial (Rs. 294 crore), and the delay of 27 days was within the condonable period of 30 days allowed under Section 34(3) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.
    * The delay was caused by administrative exigencies, including changes in the position of the Managing Director of Appellant No. 1 (the nodal agency), the need for obtaining administrative approval from the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (Appellant No. 2), and the time required for the Advocate to study the voluminous case papers (3000 pages). 
    * The appellants offered a proper explanation for the delay and not an excuse.
    * The appellants, being a State instrumentality and the Government of India respectively, deserved a more lenient approach regarding condonation of delay compared to private litigants.
    * It was in the public interest to condone the delay and allow the appellants to contest the arbitration award on merits.
* **Respondent's Argument:**
    * The stricter language used in Section 34(3) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 ("prevented by sufficient cause") required a higher standard of proof for condonation of delay than Section 5 of the Limitation Act ("sufficient cause").
    * The appellants failed to explain the delay day by day, as required under the law.
    * The appellants could have taken more urgent steps to file the application under Section 34(1) after the Ministry granted concurrence to challenge the award on 21st February 2023.
    * Administrative delays cannot be considered "sufficient cause" for condonation of delay under Section 34(3) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.
    * The State instrumentality should not be given any special privilege regarding condonation of delay and should be treated at par with private litigants.
    * The appellants were merely trying to delay the enforcement of the award in their favor.

## 5. Court's Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The High Court found that the delay of 27 days in filing the application was within the condonable limit of 30 days allowed under Section 34(3) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.
    * The Court acknowledged that the appellants had offered a sufficient cause for the delay, which was an explanation and not an excuse.
    * The Court found the appellants' explanation for the delay to be credible, including the time spent in arriving at consensus, obtaining approval for the fees schedule of the advocate, and the Advocate's time in studying the voluminous case papers.
    * The Court rejected the respondent's argument that the appellants should have challenged the award without waiting for the Ministry's approval, stating that it is for the parties to decide how to challenge an award.
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The Court interpreted the word "prevent" in Section 34(3) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 to encompass not only physical obstruction but also actions that hindered or impeded a process.
    * The Court recognized that the law of limitation is founded on public policy, but it should not be applied in a manner that results in a miscarriage of justice.
    * The Court acknowledged that the State instrumentality should not be given special treatment in terms of condonation of delay, but it also highlighted the need for a pragmatic and justice-oriented approach when dealing with the State, considering the nature of its functioning and the potential impact of delay on public interest.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The Court applied the principle of liberal construction to the provision on condonation of delay, considering the substantial value of the award and the reasonable explanation offered by the appellants for the delay.
    * The Court balanced the need for adherence to the law of limitation with the need to ensure that the appellants were not denied the opportunity to have their case heard on merits.

## 6. Judgment

* **Final Decision:** The High Court allowed the appeal.
* **Relief Granted:** The order of the Commercial Court rejecting the appellants' application for condonation of delay was set aside. The Commercial Court was directed to proceed with the disposal of the application under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 in accordance with law.
* **Orders:**
