## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Appellant's Argument (NTPC):**
    * **Maintainability of the appeal:** 
        * The appeal against the order refusing to vacate the interim order was maintainable under Section 37(1)(b) of the Arbitration Act as it dealt with the grant of interim measures. 
        * The appeal was not a civil revision application barred by Section 8 of the Commercial Courts Act. 
        * The impugned order was not interlocutory, but substantially affected NTPC's rights. 
        * The Commercial Courts Act only provided the forum for the appeal, not the substantive right, as per BGS SGS Soma JV judgment.
    * **Maintainability of the Section 9 application:** 
        * The dispute between NTPC and MPDCL should have been adjudicated by the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) under the Electricity Act.
        * The Section 9 application was premature as the CERC could either adjudicate the dispute itself or refer it to arbitration.
        * The respondents should have sought interim relief under Section 94(2) of the Electricity Act.
    * **Merits of the impugned order:**
        * The Commercial Court misinterpreted the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) and did not properly apply the judgment in Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limited.
        * The Commercial Court did not properly consider the arguments for vacating the interim order, ignoring the substantive portion of Order 39 Rule 4 CPC.
        * The respondents had not sought arbitration or expressed a clear intention to do so, which was a pre-condition for invoking Section 9 of the Arbitration Act.

* **Respondent's Argument (MPDCL):**
    * **Maintainability of the appeal:**
        * The appeal was not maintainable under Section 37(1)(b) of the Arbitration Act as the impugned order was an interlocutory order, not a final order granting or refusing interim measures.
        * Section 8 of the Commercial Courts Act barred any petition against an interlocutory order.
        * The appeal was barred under Section 13(1A) of the Commercial Courts Act, which was subject to the provisions of Section 37 of the Arbitration Act.
    * **Maintainability of the Section 9 application:**
        * The dispute was governed by the Electricity Act, which allowed for statutory arbitration.
        * Clause 7.2.1 of the PPA provided for arbitration in terms of the Electricity Act, making Section 9 of the Arbitration Act applicable.
        * Section 9 was a special provision applicable to disputes governed by the Electricity Act, and no such provision existed in the Electricity Act for interim relief.
    * **Merits of the impugned order:**
        * There was no suppression of facts, as MPDCL had disclosed the arbitration provision in the Electricity Act.
        * The Commercial Court rightly refused to vacate the interim order, as MPDCL had a prima facie case on merits and was entitled to interim protection.

## 5. Court's Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The appeal against the order refusing to vacate the interim order was not maintainable under the Arbitration Act and the Commercial Courts Act.
    * The order refusing to vacate the interim order was interlocutory and did not amount to a final order granting or refusing interim measures under Section 9 of the Arbitration Act.
    * There was no independent right of appeal under Section 13(1A) of the Commercial Courts Act, as the appeal was barred by Section 37 of the Arbitration Act.
    * Section 9 of the Arbitration Act was applicable to disputes governed by the Electricity Act, and therefore, the Section 9 application was maintainable before the Commercial Court.

* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The court interpreted the relevant provisions of the Arbitration Act, Commercial Courts Act, and Electricity Act to determine the scope of appeal and the applicability of Section 9 of the Arbitration Act.
    * The court relied on the BGS SGS Soma JV judgment, which clarified that the Commercial Courts Act only provided the forum for appeals, while the substantive right to appeal was governed by the Arbitration Act.
    * The court analyzed the interplay of these statutes to determine the proper legal framework for the dispute.
    * The court emphasized that the Arbitration Act was a complete code by itself, and appeals not specifically allowed under Section 37 of the Act were not permissible.
    * The court further emphasized that the Electricity Act allowed for statutory arbitration, which encompassed the provisions of Section 9 of the Arbitration Act.

* **Application of Law:**
    * The court applied the legal principles to the facts of the case, finding that the order appealed against was an interlocutory order, and therefore, the appeal was not maintainable.
    * The court concluded that the Commercial Court had jurisdiction to entertain MPDCL's application under Section 9 of the Arbitration Act, as the dispute was governed by the Electricity Act.
    * The court dismissed the appeal on the grounds of maintainability without considering the merits of the case.

## 6. Judgment

* **Relief Granted:** No relief was granted to the appellant.
* **Orders:**
    * The appeal was dismissed.
    * The Commercial Court was directed to hear the Section 9 application in its entirety as expeditiously as possible.

## 7. Implications

* **Impact on Law:**
    * The judgment reaffirms the importance of the BGS SGS Soma JV judgment, emphasizing that the Commercial Courts Act does not provide an independent right of appeal. 
    * It clarifies that appeals in arbitration matters are governed by the Arbitration Act, specifically Section 37, and only those orders explicitly listed in Section 37 are appealable.
    * It further clarifies that the Electricity Act allows for statutory arbitration, and therefore, Section 9 of the Arbitration Act applies to disputes arising under the Electricity Act.

* **Future Relevance:**
    * The case sets a precedent for determining the maintainability of appeals in arbitration matters governed by the Electricity Act.
    * It provides guidance on the interpretation of the Commercial Courts Act and the Arbitration Act in relation to interlocutory orders and the scope of appeals.

* **Broader Context:**
