## 2. Background and Context

* **Brief Overview:** This case involves a group of commercial suits filed in the Bombay High Court's Commercial Division. The core issue revolves around the interpretation of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, specifically its amendments to the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (CPC) regarding the filing of written statements by defendants in commercial suits.

    * Whether the Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules, 1980, supersede the amended provisions of the CPC regarding the filing of written statements in commercial suits.
    * Whether the court retains discretion under Order VIII Rule 9 to take on record a belated written statement despite the amended provisions of Order VIII Rule 1.

## 4. Arguments Presented

**Plaintiff’s Argument:**

* **Mr. Nausher Kohli:**
    * The primary aim of the Commercial Courts Act is to expedite the disposal of high-value commercial disputes.
    * The amendments introduced by the Commercial Courts Act to the CPC are mandatory, designed to establish strict timelines and reduce delays.
    * The language of the amended Order VIII Rule 1 clearly states that a written statement cannot be taken on record after 120 days.
    * The Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules, 1980, are subordinate to the Commercial Courts Act, and the provisions of the latter should prevail in case of conflict.
    * The specific provisions of Section 16 of the Commercial Courts Act mandate that the amended CPC provisions are applicable to commercial suits, even in chartered high courts.
    * Section 21 of the Commercial Courts Act has a broad non-obstante clause, which overrides conflicting provisions in other laws.
    * The previous judgments (Shailaja, Chintaman, and Nankhu) relied upon by defendants are not applicable in the context of commercial suits because the amendments to Order VIII Rule 1 introduced by the Commercial Courts Act are fundamentally different. 
    * The interpretation of Order VIII Rule 9 as argued by the defendants would render the amended Order VIII Rule 1 otiose and negate the scheme and purpose of the Commercial Courts Act.
    * The court should read down the provisions of Order VIII Rule 9 to the extent they are in conflict with the Commercial Courts Act.
    * The court should avoid applying equity or fairness to allow belated filing of written statements beyond the statutory timeframe.
    * The court should not rely on the previous notification regarding waiving service of summons in cases where the defendant enters an appearance.

**Defendant’s Argument:**

* **Mr. J.P. Sen, Sr. Adv. & Mr. Farhan Dubash:**
    * The Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules, 1980, would empower the court to condone delay and take on record a written statement even after 120 days.
    * The Apex Court's decision in Iridium establishes that the Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules are not subject to the amended provisions of the CPC.
    * The phrase "Rule of the jurisdictional High Court" in Section 16 of the Commercial Courts Act does not include the Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules.
* **Mr. Zal Andhyarujina:**
    * The court is not bound by the provisions of the CPC due to its Letters Patent.
    * The court can use Rule 265 of the Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules to condone delay and take on record a written statement.
* **Mr. Hemant Prabhulkar:**
    * The Letters Patent of the court and the rules made thereunder should override the provisions of the CPC, even as amended by the Commercial Courts Act.
    * Section 21 of the Commercial Courts Act is not a sweeping non-obstante clause.
    * The legislature did not intend to override the provisions of the Letters Patent or the Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules.
    * The Act of 1987 re-confers jurisdiction, powers, and authority on the Bombay High Court.
* **Mr. Rashmin Khandekar:**
    * The court retains discretion under Order VIII Rule 9 to take on record a belated written statement. 
    * The newly added proviso to Order VIII Rule 10 only restricts the right of the defendant to file a written statement, not the court's discretion to call for it.
    * The previous judgments (Nankhu, Shailaja, Chintaman) support the court's discretion to take on record written statements even after the expiry of the 120-day period.
    * Order XV-A of the CPC provides further powers to the court to call for pleadings and pass orders to ensure efficient disposal of the suit.
* **Mr. Firdosh Pooniwala:**
    * The provisions of Order VIII Rule 1 are directory and not mandatory. 
    * The court can allow the filing of a written statement even after 120 days.
* **Mr. Rohan Kelkar:**
    * There is a distinction between "the" written statement (Order VIII Rule 1) and "a" written statement (Order VIII Rule 9).
    * The bar under Order VIII Rule 1 applies only to "the" written statement, not "a" written statement under Order VIII Rule 9.
    * The court retains discretion to allow a written statement under Order VIII Rule 9 even after the right to file "the" written statement is forfeited.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The court recognized the primary purpose of the Commercial Courts Act is to reduce delays and expedite the disposal of commercial disputes.
    * The court found that the amended Order VIII Rule 1 of the CPC, introduced by the Commercial Courts Act, is mandatory and not discretionary.
    * The court determined that the Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules, 1980, are subordinate to the Commercial Courts Act, and in case of conflict, the latter should prevail.
    * The court ruled that the court's discretion under Order VIII Rule 9 to call for a written statement is not applicable in commercial suits after the expiry of 120 days, as this would render the amended Order VIII Rule 1 otiose.
    * The court emphasized that jurisdiction cannot be conferred by consent.
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The court interpreted the amended Order VIII Rule 1 as being mandatory, focusing on the use of the word "shall" and the specific consequences of forfeiture.
    * The court carefully examined the scope and intention of Section 16 of the Commercial Courts Act, concluding that it overrules conflicting provisions in the Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules.
    * The court considered the non-obstante clauses in both the Commercial Courts Act and the Act of 1987, finding that the provisions of the later law prevail.
    * The court analyzed the definition of "rule" in the General Clauses Act, 1897, and determined that "Rule" in Section 16(3) of the Commercial Courts Act includes the Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules.
    * The court acknowledged that previous judgments (Nankhu, Shailaja, Chintaman) were decided in a different context, before the amendments introduced by the Commercial Courts Act.
    * The court recognized that the principle of equity cannot override clear statutory provisions. 
* **Application of Law:**
    * The court applied the principles of statutory interpretation, including harmonious construction, mischief rule, and the rule that specific provisions supersede general provisions.
    * The court applied the principle of later law prevails to determine that the Commercial Courts Act overrides the Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules and the Act of 1987.
    * The court applied the doctrine of stare decisis, considering relevant previous judgments but distinguishing them based on the amendments introduced by the Commercial Courts Act.

## 6. Judgment

* **Final Decision:** The court decided that in commercial suits, a written statement by the defendant cannot be taken on record after the expiry of 120 days from the date of service of the writ of summons.
* **Relief Granted:** No relief granted as this was a reference hearing to settle the question of law.
* **Orders:** The court directed the Commercial Division of the Bombay High Court to adhere to the provisions of the Commercial Courts Act while adjudicating commercial disputes.
