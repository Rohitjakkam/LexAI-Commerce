## 4. Arguments Presented

    * The Arbitral Tribunal properly considered the evidence and concluded that the Respondent was bound by the Certificate of quality issued by their appointed agency, Inspectorate Griffith.

    * The Appellant delivered the contracted quantity as per the revised agreement between the parties.
* **Respondent's Argument:**
    * The Arbitral Tribunal's award was based on incomplete reasoning and a misinterpretation of the contract, particularly Clause 17. 
    * The Arbitral Tribunal failed to address key issues, including the validity of the Inspectorate Griffith Certificate, the discrepancy in FE content between the initial and final testing, and the Appellant's failure to deliver the full contracted quantity.
    * The Commercial Court correctly intervened under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act to rectify the errors and ensure a fair outcome.
