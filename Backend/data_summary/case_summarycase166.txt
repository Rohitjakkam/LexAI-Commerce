## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Appellant's Argument (DGVCL):**
    * ESIL had breached the 2010 agreement by using DGVCL's electricity for its group companies, not just its own operations. 
    * DGVCL's claim for unpaid dues is a "statutory due" and thus, not extinguished under ESIL's resolution plan.
    * The Commercial Court erred by dismissing DGVCL's suit summarily under Order XIII A of the CPC without sufficient opportunity to contest.
    * The ESIL SC judgment, while acknowledging DGVCL's claim, did not extinguish it. The notional amount of INR 1/- admitted in the resolution plan was merely for ensuring DGVCL's participation in the CIRP and not a final adjudication of its claim.
    * The Rainbow Papers judgment supports DGVCL's position that statutory dues should not be waived under resolution plans. 
* **Respondent's Argument (ESIL/Arcelor Mittal):**
    * ESIL's resolution plan, approved by the NCLT, NCLAT, and the Supreme Court, extinguished all claims against the company, including DGVCL's claim.
    * The ESIL SC judgment clearly established that the resolution plan creates a "fresh slate" for the new entity, ArcelorMittal, and that any pre-CIRP claims are extinguished. 
    * DGVCL's claim, admitted at a notional value of INR 1/- in the resolution plan, implies it was fully settled.
    * The Commercial Court was correct to dismiss DGVCL's suit under Order XIII A of the CPC as the claim lacked merit after the ESIL SC judgment.
    * DGVCL's claim is barred by res judicata as it was already considered and adjudicated under the resolution plan.

## 5. Court's Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The court acknowledged the ESIL SC judgment's emphasis on the "fresh slate" principle and the extinguishment of pre-CIRP claims.
    * However, the court also recognized that the ESIL SC judgment did not specifically address the issue of statutory dues.
    * The court found that the Commercial Court's dismissal of DGVCL's suit through a summary judgment under Order XIII A of the CPC was premature and procedurally flawed.
    * The court held that while the notional amount of INR 1/- admitted for DGVCL's claim in the resolution plan was not a final adjudication of the claim, it did not necessarily extinguish the entire claim.
    * The court considered the Rainbow Papers judgment, which emphasized the importance of protecting statutory dues.
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The court interpreted the ESIL SC judgment as applying to claims generally, but not necessarily to statutory dues.
    * The court interpreted Order XIII A of the CPC as requiring strict compliance with procedural safeguards to ensure a fair hearing and prevent premature dismissal of claims.
    * The court interpreted the IBC as aiming to protect statutory dues while allowing for a fresh start for companies undergoing CIRP.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The court applied the "fresh slate" principle of the ESIL SC judgment to ESIL's obligations but distinguished statutory dues.
    * The court applied the procedural requirements of Order XIII A of the CPC and found the Commercial Court's summary judgment to be procedurally defective.
    * The court applied the principle of protecting statutory dues as outlined in the Rainbow Papers judgment.

## 6. Judgment

* **Final Decision:** The court allowed DGVCL's appeal and quashed the Commercial Court's summary judgment.
* **Relief Granted:** The suit was remitted back to the Commercial Court for a full trial on merits. 
* **Orders:** The Commercial Court was directed to conduct a fair and expeditious trial of the suit, considering all legal arguments and evidence presented by both sides.

## 7. Implications

* **Impact on Law:**
    * This judgment clarifies that the "fresh slate" principle of the ESIL SC judgment does not automatically extinguish all pre-CIRP claims, particularly those related to statutory dues.
    * The judgment emphasizes the importance of procedural fairness in summary judgments, reminding courts to ensure sufficient opportunity to contest claims.
    * The judgment suggests a potential distinction between general pre-CIRP claims and statutory dues in the context of resolution plans.
* **Future Relevance:** This judgment provides guidance for future cases involving statutory dues and resolution plans under the IBC. Courts may be more inclined to scrutinize summary judgments and ensure that statutory dues are adequately protected.
* **Broader Context:** This judgment highlights the balancing act between protecting the rights of creditors (like DGVCL) and facilitating the successful rehabilitation of companies undergoing CIRP.

## 8. Summary Points

* DGVCL's claim for unpaid electricity dues was not automatically extinguished by ESIL's resolution plan.
* Statutory dues may require special consideration under the IBC, and their protection may not be fully covered by the "fresh slate" principle.
* Courts must follow procedural safeguards in summary judgments to ensure fairness and avoid premature dismissals.
* This case reinforces the importance of protecting the rights of creditors, particularly when it comes to statutory dues, while acknowledging the objectives of the IBC.
