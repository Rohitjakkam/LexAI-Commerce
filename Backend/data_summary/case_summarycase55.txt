## Arguments Presented

**Appellant’s Argument (SBPDCL):**

* The 5th Additional District Judge had no jurisdiction to hear the matter because the 2015 Act had established Commercial Courts for commercial disputes of a certain value, and the District Judge, Patna had been appointed as the Commercial Court judge for the jurisdiction.
* BEDCPL lacked locus standi to bring the matter for arbitration or to file an application under Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, as SPML Infra Limited was the actual party to the agreement and responsible for the bank guarantee. 
* The court below had misconducted the proceedings by granting the injunction without considering the appellant's arguments and without ensuring the due process of law.

**Respondent’s Argument (BEDCPL):**

*  The District Judge, Patna had transferred the case to the 5th Additional District Judge, Patna, who has concurrent jurisdiction.
* The agreement clearly established BEDCPL as a party to the tripartite agreement, and the appellant had consented to the establishment of a Special Purpose Vehicle.
*  The respondent's claim was legitimate, and the bank guarantee was crucial to protecting the respondent's interests while the dispute was pending.

## Court's Analysis and Reasoning

**Key Findings:**

* The court found that the State Government, in exercise of its power under Section 3 of the 2015 Act, had notified the constitution of Commercial Courts, and the District Judge, Patna had been appointed as the sole judge for this purpose.
* The court held that the 5th Additional District Judge, Patna did not have jurisdiction to hear the matter as the designated Commercial Court was already in existence.
* While the court did not decide the issue of BEDCPL's locus standi, it highlighted that the respondent was established as a Special Purpose Vehicle with the appellant's consent, and the agreement acknowledged the respondent as a party.
* The court observed that the impugned order was procedurally deficient, lacking a proper examination of the arguments and the appellant's locus standi, leading to a violation of the principles of natural justice.

**Interpretation of Law:**

* The court interpreted the provisions of the 2015 Act to establish that the Commercial Court was the designated forum for such disputes once the Act came into force.
* The court referred to precedents regarding the transfer of contractual obligations to determine the application of Section 230 of the Indian Contract Act.

**Application of Law:**

* The court applied the principle of jurisdiction to declare that the court below was not the appropriate forum to hear the case.
*  The court applied the principle of natural justice to find that the impugned order was flawed due to procedural irregularities and the failure to consider the appellant's arguments.

## Judgment

**Final Decision:**

* The court allowed the appeal and set aside the impugned order of the 5th Additional District Judge, Patna.

**Relief Granted:**

* The court remitted the matter back to the Commercial Court, Patna to hear and pass necessary orders according to law.
