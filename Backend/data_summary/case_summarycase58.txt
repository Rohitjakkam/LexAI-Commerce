## Arguments Presented

**Defendant’s Argument (Respondents):**

* The petition under Article 227 of the Constitution is barred by Section 8 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015.

* The Commercial Court rightfully exercised its discretion in condoning the delay, acknowledging the legal principle that time spent resolving procedural defects should be condoned.

## Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

**Key Findings:**

* The court acknowledged the legislative intent behind the Commercial Courts Act to expedite commercial proceedings and limit challenges to interlocutory orders.
