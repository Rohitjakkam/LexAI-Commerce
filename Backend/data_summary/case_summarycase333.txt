## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Appellant’s Argument:**
    * The Commercial Court erred in granting the injunction without properly considering the three parameters for interim injunctions. 
    * The order violated Section 9(3) of the Act because the Arbitral Tribunal had been constituted prior to the order being passed. 
    * The Court should not have entertained the respondent’s application under Section 9 once the Arbitral Tribunal had been formed, as the remedy under Section 17 (powers of the Arbitral Tribunal) was available.
* **Respondent’s Argument:**
    * The Commercial Court was justified in granting the injunction as the appellant had failed to respond to the application within the prescribed time. 
    * The appellant was prohibited from using the "Sunbeam" name and logo by the CBSE and the Basic Shiksha Adhikari, Varanasi.
    * The term "entertain" in Section 9(3) means "to consider the application by applying mind to the issues involved/raised," which the Commercial Court had done.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The Commercial Court failed to properly record findings on the three parameters for interim injunctions (prima facie case, balance of convenience, and irreparable injury) and, therefore, the order was vitiated.
    * The Commercial Court violated Section 9(3) of the Act by passing the order after the Arbitral Tribunal had been constituted.
    * The Commercial Court's consideration of the respondent's applications concerning dismissal and amendments did not amount to a consideration on merits for the purpose of granting an injunction.
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The court interpreted the term "entertain" in Section 9(3) to mean "to consider by application of mind to the issues raised." This meant that once the Arbitral Tribunal had been constituted, the court could not take up an application under Section 9 for consideration unless the remedy under Section 17 was inefficacious.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The court applied the principle that the Commercial Court should not have entertained the respondent’s application under Section 9 once the Arbitral Tribunal had been constituted because the remedy under Section 17 was available.
    * The court applied the principles of injunctions, emphasizing the need for the Commercial Court to properly record findings on the three essential parameters.

## 6. Judgment

* **Final Decision:** The appeal filed by the appellant was allowed.
* **Relief Granted:** The order dated 18.01.2024 passed by the Commercial Court was quashed and set aside. The application filed by the respondent under Section 9 of the Act was dismissed.
* **Orders:** The respondent was free to approach the Arbitral Tribunal under Section 17 of the Act.

## 7. Implications

* **Impact on Law:** This case clarifies the interpretation of the term "entertain" in Section 9(3) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. It reaffirms the principle that once an Arbitral Tribunal is constituted, a court should not entertain an application under Section 9 unless the remedy under Section 17 is inefficacious.
* **Future Relevance:** This case sets a precedent for future cases involving the interplay between Section 9 and Section 17 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.
* **Broader Context:** This case highlights the importance of proper judicial review in arbitration proceedings and emphasizes the need for courts to follow established principles when granting interim injunctions.
