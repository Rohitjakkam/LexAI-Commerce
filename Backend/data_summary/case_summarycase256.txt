* **Key Findings:**
    * The court examined the amended provisions of Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, particularly the proviso limiting appeals to orders enumerated in Order XLIII of the CPC.

* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The court interpreted the "shall" and "specifically" terms in the proviso of Section 13 as limitations on appealability.
    * The court differentiated the cases cited by the Defendant, highlighting the fact that the present appeal was against a decision by a Commercial Court under the Act of 2015, not by a Commercial Division of the High Court, as in the cited cases. 
* **Application of Law:**
    * The court applied the established legal principles concerning jurisdiction and the interpretation of statutory provisions.
