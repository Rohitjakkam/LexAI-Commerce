## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Petitioner’s Argument:**
    * The Commercial Court had no jurisdiction to entertain the respondent's Section 34 application while the Section 33 application was pending before the Arbitral Tribunal.
    * The Section 34 application was premature and infructuous as the right to challenge the award only arose after the disposal of the Section 33 application.
    * The impugned orders passed by the Commercial Court were illegal and without jurisdiction, as they interfered with the arbitral proceedings and the award.
    * The petitioner was deprived of the fruits of the award due to the Commercial Court's orders.
    * Article 227 of the Constitution provided the petitioner with an efficacious remedy as the Arbitration Act did not provide any relief in this specific situation.
* **Respondent’s Argument:**
    * The petition was not maintainable under Article 227 as the Arbitration Act is a self-contained code, and Section 5 bars judicial interference except as prescribed under the Act.
    * Section 37 of the Act enumerates the categories of appealable orders, and the impugned orders did not fall under any of them.
    * Section 8 of the Commercial Courts Act bars revisions against interlocutory orders, including those on jurisdictional issues.
    * The petitioner had submitted to the jurisdiction of the Commercial Court by filing objections in Misc. applications.
    * The petitioner had contested the impugned orders on merits, and therefore, must pursue the remedies prescribed under the Arbitration Act.
    * There was no statutory bar for filing a Section 34 application during the pendency of a Section 33 application.
    * The respondent's right to challenge the award under Section 34 would have expired if the application was not filed.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The Court acknowledged the Arbitration Act as a self-contained code and the restrictions imposed by Section 5 on judicial interference.
    * The Court recognized the limited scope of interference under Article 227 and the need to exercise this power sparingly to correct patent errors.
    * The Court interpreted Section 34(3) to emphasize the unbreakability of the three-month limitation period for challenging an award.
    * The Court found that the Section 34 application filed by the respondent during the pendency of the Section 33 application was premature and violated the intent of the Act, as the right to challenge the award only arose after the disposal of the Section 33 application.
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The Court interpreted Section 34(3) to mean that the three-month limitation period for challenging an award starts running from the date of disposal of the Section 33 application.
    * The Court emphasized the "certainty and expediency" principle associated with the arbitral process and the need to avoid parallel proceedings.
    * The Court held that the supervisory jurisdiction under Article 227 should be exercised only to correct patent errors and prevent a miscarriage of justice.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The Court applied the principles of statutory interpretation and precedent to determine the scope of the relevant statutory provisions.
    * The Court applied the legal doctrines of limitation, natural justice, and supervisory jurisdiction to analyze the arguments and decide the case.

## 6. Judgment

* **Final Decision:** The petition was partially allowed.
* **Relief Granted:**
    * The impugned orders dated 29-10-2021, 17-11-2021, and 10-12-2021 were set aside as far as they related to the stay of the interim arbitral award dated 27-07-2021.
    * The Commercial Court was directed to re-examine the respondent's Section 34 application afresh, affording an opportunity to the petitioner before passing any further orders.
* **Orders:**
    * The parties were directed to appear before the Commercial Court on 7th March 2022 for resumption of the proceedings.
    * Each party was to bear their own costs.

* **Future Relevance:** The case provides guidance on the exercise of supervisory jurisdiction under Article 227 in the context of arbitration proceedings and emphasizes the need to avoid unnecessary interference with the arbitral process.
