## 1. Case Title

* **Case Name:** Gautam Hari Singhania vs Hari Shankar Singhania & 20 Ors. 
* **Court:** Bombay High Court
* **Date of Judgment:** 29th March, 2017
* **Citation:** COMAP/4/2016, COMAPL/5/2016, COMAPL/6/2016

## 2. Background and Context

* **Brief Overview:** The case arises from a dispute over the distribution of immovable properties of the dissolved partnership firm Juggilal Kamlapat Bankers. The firm was dissolved in 1987, and disputes over the distribution led to an arbitration suit in 1992. The Arbitrator issued an award in 2008, which was challenged and ultimately upheld by the Bombay High Court. The present appeals stem from execution proceedings initiated in 2015 to enforce the award.
* **Key Issues:** The main legal issue is whether the order passed by the Single Judge in the execution proceedings of the arbitral award is appealable under Section 13(1) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015. The Appellants argue that the order has the effect of finality and, therefore, qualifies as a "decision" under Section 13(1). The Respondents argue that the order is not a decree and that appeals are only allowed in specific circumstances enumerated in the proviso to Section 13(1).

## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Appellant's Argument:**
    * The Appellants argue that the order passed by the Single Judge in the execution proceedings has the effect of finality and, therefore, qualifies as a "decision" under Section 13(1) of the Commercial Courts Act.
    * They contend that the order is in the nature of a decree, relying on the provisions of Order XXI of the CPC and the legal fiction created by Section 36 of the Arbitration Act.
    * They argue that the proviso to Section 13(1) is an enabling provision that provides an additional right of appeal and does not exclude appeals against orders that have attained finality.
    * They emphasize that the word "decision" in Section 13(1) should be given a broad interpretation and should encompass orders that conclusively determine the rights of the parties.
    * They submit that the order passed in execution proceedings affects their vital and valuable rights and, therefore, has the force of a final judgment.
* **Respondent's Argument:**
    * The Respondents argue that the order passed in the execution proceedings is not a decree and, therefore, is not appealable under Section 13(1) of the Commercial Courts Act.
    * They contend that the order falls within the ambit of Section 47 of the CPC, which deals with all questions relating to the delivery of property in execution, and is not specifically enumerated in the proviso to Section 13(1) as an appealable order.
    * They emphasize that the proceedings under Section 36 of the Arbitration Act are not proceedings under the CPC and that the legal fiction created by the Act is limited to the purpose of enforcement.
    * They argue that the Commercial Courts Act has expressly excluded the applicability of the Letters Patent and, therefore, the order is not appealable under that provision.
    * They contend that the interpretation of the word "decision" should be restricted to a "decree" and that the proviso to Section 13(1) only allows appeals against specific orders enumerated under Order XLIII of the CPC and Section 37 of the Arbitration Act.

## 5. Court's Analysis and Reasoning
