## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Petitioner's Argument:**

    * The petitioner faces difficulty in executing the award due to the expiration of the bank guarantee and the need to avoid lengthy execution proceedings.
    * The petitioner sought to avoid paying stamp duty on the award by seeking invocation of the bank guarantee, which could have been addressed by the Commercial Court. 
* **Respondent's Argument:**
    * The Commercial Court lost jurisdiction to issue further directions after dismissing the respondent's petition under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act.
    * The petitioner should file an execution petition under Section 36 of the Arbitration Act for enforcement of the award.
    * The petitioner sought to avoid paying stamp duty on the award by filing an application under Section 151 of CPC.
    * The bank guarantee was provided as security during the pendency of Section 34 proceedings and not for enforcement of the award.

## 5. Court's Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The bank guarantee was given as security during the pendency of the Section 34 proceedings and not for enforcement of the award under Section 36.
    * The petitioner cannot convert Section 34 proceedings into Section 36 proceedings for enforcement of the award by filing an application under Section 151 of CPC.
    * The petitioner is required to file an application for enforcement under Section 36 of the Arbitration Act and pay stamp duty on the award.
    * The Commercial Court was justified in refusing to invoke the bank guarantee because it was given as security during the Section 34 proceedings, and no event or condition specified in the bank guarantee arose.
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The court emphasized that the High Court under Article 227 of the Constitution of India has supervisory jurisdiction and cannot act as an appellate court.
    * The court interpreted Section 34 of the Arbitration Act as not providing for review of orders passed under it.
    * The court applied Section 36 of the Arbitration Act for enforcement of awards and the requirement of paying stamp duty on the award.
    * The court highlighted that the functus officio doctrine applies to courts after they have concluded proceedings under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The court applied the principles of supervisory jurisdiction under Article 227 to uphold the Commercial Court's decision.
    * The court found that the petitioner had not exhausted other legal remedies, making Article 227 jurisdiction inappropriate in this case.
