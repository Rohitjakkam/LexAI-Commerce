## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Plaintiff’s Arguments:**
    * The Commercial Courts Act, 2015 does not restrict the scope of appellability as understood in the Madras High Court's original civil jurisdiction. 
    * The expression "judgment or order" in Section 13 of the Act should be interpreted broadly to include both decrees and orders.
    * The proviso to Section 13(1A) of the Act merely clarifies, rather than restricts, the scope of appellability.
    * Section 13(2) of the Act does not apply to judgments, only orders and decrees.
    * The Act should not be applied retrospectively to suits filed before the establishment of the Commercial Division.
    * The right to appeal is a substantive right, inhering in a party at the time the suit is filed.
    * The Madras High Court has jurisdiction to hear the suits in question, even if a part of the cause of action arose outside the jurisdiction.
    * The plaintiff suffered losses within the jurisdiction of the Madras High Court, making it an appropriate forum.
    * The plaintiff's suits are not barred by the moratorium provisions of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016.
    * The defendants' arguments regarding forum non conveniens are not compelling.
* **Defendant’s Arguments:**
    * The Commercial Courts Act, 2015 significantly restricts the scope of appellability in the Madras High Court.
    * The Act applies to suits filed after its enactment, even if the Commercial Division was established later.
    * The expression "judgment or order" in Section 13 of the Act should be interpreted narrowly, excluding certain orders that were previously appellable.
    * Section 13(2) of the Act effectively supersedes the provisions of Letters Patent, restricting appeals to those specifically provided for in the Act.
    * The Madras High Court lacks jurisdiction to hear the suits in question, as the majority of the cause of action arose outside the jurisdiction.
    * The plaintiff's choice of forum is inappropriate due to inconvenience and the possibility of conflicting judgments.
    * The plaintiff's suits are barred by the moratorium provisions of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The court finds that the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, intended to expedite the resolution of commercial disputes. This objective necessitates a restricted scope of appellability to ensure timely judgments.
    * The court interprets the expression "judgment or order" in Section 13 of the Act to include decrees, as it would be absurd to suggest that appeals from interlocutory orders are permissible while those from final decrees are not.
    * The court holds that the proviso to Section 13(1A) of the Act, read in conjunction with Section 13(2), implies a restriction on the scope of appellability, limiting it to orders specifically enumerated in Order XLIII of the Code and those provided for in the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.
    * The court finds that the Act applies to suits filed after its enactment, even if the Commercial Division was established later.
    * The court determines that the Madras High Court lacks jurisdiction to hear the suits involving DHFL, as the majority of the cause of action arose in Mumbai.
    * The court rejects the defendants' arguments regarding the plaintiff's suits being barred by the moratorium provisions of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, finding that the plaintiff's suits against the other defendants are permissible.

* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The court analyzes the language of the Act and its legislative intent, recognizing the Act as a complete code for commercial disputes.
    * The court clarifies the meaning of "judgment" and "order" in the context of the Act, drawing from the definitions provided in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.
    * The court interprets the proviso to Section 13(1A) of the Act as a restrictive provision, limiting the scope of appellability.
    * The court examines the non-obstante clause in Section 13(2) of the Act, recognizing its effect on the applicability of Letters Patent provisions.
    * The court analyzes the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013, particularly Section 35, to determine the scope of civil liability for mis-statements in a prospectus.
    * The court reviews the relevant provisions of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, specifically Section 14, to determine the effect of the moratorium on the plaintiff's suits against DHFL.

* **Application of Law:**
    * The court applies the restrictive interpretation of Section 13 of the Act to determine the appellability of various orders.
    * The court applies the principle of forum non conveniens to decide the appropriate forum for the suits against the defendants.
    * The court applies the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 to determine the liability of the various defendants.
    * The court applies the provisions of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 to determine the effect of the moratorium on the plaintiff's suits against DHFL.
