    * **Perverse Findings:** Findings made by a lower court that are so unreasonable that no reasonable person could arrive at them.
    * **Liberal Interpretation of Procedural Rules:** Courts generally favor a less strict approach to procedural rules when they do not cause serious prejudice to the other party.
    * **Reasonable Cause:** A higher standard than "sufficient cause" or "good cause", requiring a more compelling justification for failing to comply with a procedural requirement.

## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Petitioner's Argument:**
    * The Original Side Rules applied to Commercial Courts in Delhi, and therefore the respondents should not have been able to file documents after the pleadings were complete.
    * The respondents failed to show "reasonable cause" for not filing the documents with their written statement, making the additional documents inadmissible.
    * Allowing the additional documents was an abuse of process since they were filed after the petitioner had filed its replication.
* **Respondent's Argument:**
    * The Original Side Rules did not apply to Commercial Courts.
    * The COVID-19 pandemic constituted "reasonable cause" for the delay in filing the documents with the written statement.
    * The documents were filed within the extended period of limitation for filing pleadings due to the pandemic.
    * Order XI Rule 1(10) was not a strict requirement, and even if the documents were not filed with the written statement, they could still be taken on record.

## 5. Courtâ€™s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The Original Side Rules did not apply to Commercial Courts in Delhi.
    * The COVID-19 pandemic constituted "reasonable cause" for the respondents' delay in filing documents.
    * The respondents' written statement and documents were filed within the extended period of limitation for filing pleadings due to the pandemic.
    * The documents were not belatedly filed, and there was no need to strictly adhere to Order XI Rule 1(10) in this case.
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The court interpreted the Supreme Court's orders regarding extending limitations periods during the pandemic as applying to all legal proceedings, including filing pleadings.
    * The court interpreted "reasonable cause" in Order XI Rule 1(10) broadly, accepting the pandemic as a valid justification for the delay.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The court applied the extended limitation period due to the pandemic to the case, determining that the respondents' written statement and documents were filed within the permitted time.
    * The court applied the principle of liberal interpretation to procedural rules, accepting the respondents' explanation for the delay and allowing the documents to be taken on record.
