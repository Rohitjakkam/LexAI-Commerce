## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Plaintiff’s Argument:** (KBJNL)
    * The trial court rightly allowed the plaintiff to adduce further evidence as the power of attorney holder who testified for the plaintiff was not authorized to give evidence on all aspects of the case. 
    * The plaintiff argued that Order 18 Rule 4(1B) of CPC allows for the admission of additional evidence upon showing sufficient cause.
    * The plaintiff further argued that Section 8 of the CCA does not completely bar the High Court's jurisdiction under Article 227 of the Constitution.
* **Defendant’s Argument:** (Reddy)
    * The trial court erred in allowing the plaintiff to adduce further evidence after the matter was posted for arguments.
    * The defendant argued that the plaintiff had not complied with the requirements of Order 18 Rule 4(1A) and Order 15A of CPC regarding the filing of affidavits and witness lists.
    * The defendant contended that the plaintiff had failed to establish sufficient cause for leading further evidence.
    * The defendant argued that the writ petition challenging the trial court's order is maintainable in light of the legal infirmities in the order and the potential for grave injustice to the defendant.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The court found that the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 significantly amended the Code of Civil Procedure to expedite commercial disputes.
    * The court emphasized the importance of adhering to the timeframes and procedures outlined in the amended CPC for commercial suits, particularly those relating to case management hearings and witness affidavits.
    * The court concluded that the trial court had wrongly allowed the plaintiff's application for further evidence as it did not satisfy the requirements of Order 18 Rule 4(1B) of CPC. 
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The court interpreted Order 18 Rule 4(1A) and (1B) of CPC as amended by the CCA to require the simultaneous filing of all witness affidavits at the time directed in the case management hearing.
    * The court held that the trial court could only allow further evidence under Order 18 Rule 4(1B) upon showing sufficient cause.
    * The court recognized the bar imposed by Section 8 of the CCA but acknowledged that this bar is not absolute and the High Court may intervene in exceptional circumstances where there is a manifest error and the potential for grave injustice.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The court found that the plaintiff had not filed its own affidavit in lieu of evidence as required by the CPC and that the plaintiff had failed to establish sufficient cause for allowing further evidence.
    * The court held that the trial court's order was based on a wrong premise and that the defendant's willingness to accept the power of attorney holder's evidence nullified the plaintiff's concern regarding the competency of the power of attorney.
    * The court concluded that the trial court's order would likely delay the proceedings and therefore violated the objective of Section 8 of the CCA.

* **Relief Granted:** The impugned order dated 13.06.2023 passed by the Court of Principal District & Sessions Judge and Commercial Court, Raichur on IA-XI in Commercial O.S. No.1/2018 is quashed. IA-XI is dismissed.
