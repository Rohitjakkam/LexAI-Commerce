## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Plaintiff’s Argument:** 
    * The petitioner argued that the Commercial Court should have given him further opportunities to adduce evidence after the defendants amended their written statements.
    * He claimed that the defendants' amendments to their written statements introduced new issues that required him to present additional evidence.
    * He argued that the Commercial Court's decision to close his right to present evidence without considering the impact of the defendants' amendments was unfair and violated principles of natural justice.
* **Defendant’s Argument:**
    * The defendants argued that the petitioner had been granted multiple opportunities to present his evidence and his failure to do so was his own fault.
    * They argued that the amendments to their written statements were merely elaborations of their existing pleadings and did not introduce new issues requiring the petitioner to adduce additional evidence.
    * They argued that the petitioner's request for further opportunities to present evidence was simply an attempt to delay the proceedings.
    * They argued that the petitioner's application for supervisory jurisdiction under Article 227 of the Constitution was not justified, as the Commercial Court's decision was within its jurisdiction and did not violate any principles of natural justice.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The Court noted that the commercial suit had been pending for over 10 years and the petitioner had been granted numerous opportunities to present evidence, including six "last" opportunities.
    * The Court recognized that the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, mandates the expeditious resolution of commercial disputes and that the Commercial Court had a duty to ensure timely disposal of the case.
    * The Court found that the defendants' amendments to their written statements were simply elaborations of their existing pleadings and did not introduce new issues requiring the petitioner to present additional evidence.
    * The Court recognized the limited scope of its supervisory jurisdiction under Article 227 of the Constitution and the principle that it cannot interfere with the decisions of lower courts merely because another view is possible.
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The Court interpreted the provisions of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, and emphasized the legislative intent to expedite commercial dispute resolution.
    * The Court also interpreted the scope of its supervisory jurisdiction under Article 227 of the Constitution and the principle of judicial restraint in such matters.
