* **Case Name:** M/S Bansal Infra Projects Pvt. Ltd. vs. M/S Jindal Steel & Power Ltd.
* **Court:** Orissa High Court, Cuttack
* **Date of Judgment:** 20th August 2024
* **Citation:**  W.P.(C) No.11848 of 2024 (Orissa High Court)

## 2. Background and Context

**Brief Overview:** Bansal Infra Projects Pvt. Ltd. (Bansal) was contracted by Jindal Steel & Power Ltd. (JSPL) to construct 400 flats. JSPL provided an advance payment of 8.5% of the contract value, secured by a Bank Guarantee (BG) from Bansal. The project faced delays due to JSPL's alleged failure to fulfill its contractual obligations, such as timely material supply and site preparation. JSPL invoked the BG, claiming Bansal's non-performance, and Bansal filed an Arbitration Petition under Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (the Act, 1996). The Commercial Court rejected Bansal's application for ex-parte injunction to prevent BG encashment, leading to this Writ Petition.

* **Applicability of Order 39 Rule 3 of CPC in Section 9 Proceedings:** Whether the Commercial Court was justified in rejecting the application under Order 39 Rule 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC) in a Section 9 application.
* **Scope of Judicial Interference in Bank Guarantee Encashment:**  Whether and under what circumstances injunction can be granted against invocation of an unconditional bank guarantee.

## 4. Arguments Presented

**Plaintiff’s Argument (Bansal):**

* **Maintainability of Writ Petition:** The Petitioner argues that they are remediless due to lack of clarity under Section 37(1)(b) of the Act, 1996 on the appealability of interlocutory orders in Section 9 proceedings.
* **Applicability of Order 39 Rule 3 of CPC:**  The Petitioner contends that they were entitled to an ex-parte injunction because the Commercial Court failed to consider the documents submitted, which demonstrated irreparable harm and exceptional circumstances.
* **Scope of Judicial Interference in Bank Guarantee Encashment:** Bansal claims that the BG was not a performance BG but was meant to secure an advance payment. Their outstanding bills and JSPL's failure to fulfill contractual obligations create special equities warranting injunction against BG encashment.

**Defendant’s Argument (JSPL):**

* **Maintainability of Writ Petition:** The Defendant argues that an appeal under Section 37(1)(b) of the Act, 1996 is available, rendering the writ petition not maintainable. They also cite the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, which restricts revision applications or petitions against interlocutory orders.
* **Applicability of Order 39 Rule 3 of CPC:**  JSPL claims that Order 39 Rule 3 of CPC is not applicable to Section 9 proceedings. They contend that the Commercial Court correctly rejected Bansal's application for ex-parte injunction because Bansal failed to demonstrate exceptional circumstances or irreparable harm.
* **Scope of Judicial Interference in Bank Guarantee Encashment:** JSPL argues that the BG was valid and invoked rightfully based on Bansal's failure to perform contractual obligations. They highlight the general principle of non-interference with unconditional bank guarantees unless fraud or special equities exist, which Bansal failed to establish. 

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

**Key Findings:**

* **Interlocutory Order Not Appealable:** The Court, analyzing various High Court judgments and the relevant Acts, concludes that an interlocutory order rejecting an application for ex-parte injunction in a Section 9 proceeding is not appealable.
* **Application of Order 39 Rule 3 Inapplicable:** The Court concurs with the coordinate Bench's view in the Sai Concrete Pavers case, that applications under Order 39 Rule 3 of CPC in Section 9 proceedings should be treated as part of the Section 9 application. 
* **Exceptional Circumstances for Injunction:** The Court recognizes the well-established exceptions to non-interference with bank guarantee encashment, namely fraud, irretrievable harm or injustice, and special equities.

**Interpretation of Law:**

* The Court analyzes the provisions of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 and the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, noting the Act's priority over the C.C. Act, but leaving procedural aspects to the C.C. Act.
* The Court interprets the Supreme Court's precedents on bank guarantees, outlining the general principle of non-interference and the exceptions.

**Application of Law:**

* The Court applies the principle of harmonious construction to reconcile the Acts and the CPC, interpreting the statutes consistently.
* The Court assesses the pleadings and documents in the case, focusing on the allegations of JSPL's non-performance, Bansal's pending bills, and the terms of the Bank Guarantee.

* The Court dismisses the Writ Petition, ruling that the interim order dated 20.05.2024 restraining JSPL from invoking the BG will remain in force until the disposal of ARBP No. 14 of 2024, subject to the extension of the Bank Guarantee by 31.12.2024.

**Relief Granted:**

* The Court directs both parties to appear before the Commercial Court in ARBP No. 14 of 2024.
* JSPL is required to file its objections in the Section 9 application within ten days.
