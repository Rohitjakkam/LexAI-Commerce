##  1. Case Title

* **Case Name:** Rajasthan Rajya Vidyut Utpadan Nigam Ltd. vs. Parsa Kente Collieries Ltd.
* **Court:** Rajasthan High Court
* **Date of Judgment:** 28 February 2018
* **Citation:** D.B. Civil Miscellaneous Appeal No. 3785/2017

## 2. Background and Context

* **Brief Overview:** Rajasthan Rajya Vidyut Utpadan Nigam Limited (RVUNL), a power generating company owned by the State of Rajasthan, entered into a Joint Venture Agreement with Adani Enterprises Limited to form a company, Parsa Kente Collieries Limited (PKCL), for coal block development and mining. The agreement (CMDA) stipulated a commencement date for coal supply within 48 months from the date of allocation (25.06.2007), with a possible extension due to force majeure events. Delays in obtaining clearances led to an extension of the commencement date to 25.03.2013. Disputes arose regarding the price adjustment clause, fixed costs, and deductions for an Escrow Account opened for mine closure. 
* **Key Issues:** 
    * Whether the price adjustment clause should be applied with reference to the original commencement date (25.06.2011) or the extended date (25.03.2013).
    * Whether RVUNL is liable for fixed costs incurred by PKCL due to RVUNL's inability to off-take the scheduled quantity of coal.
    * Whether RVUNL was justified in deducting money from PKCL's coal supply bills for deposit in the Escrow Account for mine closure.

## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Appellant's Argument (RVUNL):**
    * The price adjustment clause should be applied with reference to the extended commencement date (25.03.2013), not the original date (25.06.2011).
    * RVUNL is not liable for fixed costs incurred by PKCL because those costs arose from PKCL's agreement with AMPL, a third party.
    * The deductions for the Escrow Account were justified because PKCL agreed to them and they were within the scope of work defined in the CMDA.
    * The award was patently illegal and against public policy because it misconstrued the CMDA, violated the principles of awarding damages, and ignored PKCL's acceptance of the escrow deduction policy.
* **Respondent's Argument (PKCL):**
    * The price adjustment clause should be applied with reference to the original commencement date (25.06.2011) because the force majeure clause does not preclude price adjustment for the period covered by the delay.
    * RVUNL's inability to off-take the scheduled quantity of coal constituted a breach of contract, making them liable for PKCL's fixed costs.
    * RVUNL was not justified in deducting money from PKCL's coal supply bills for the Escrow Account because the responsibility for mine closure lay with RVUNL, the mine owner.
    * The arbitral award was based on a plausible interpretation of the CMDA and did not violate public policy.

## 5. Court's Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The court agreed with RVUNL's interpretation of the commencement date, holding that the extended date (25.03.2013) was the operative date for applying the price adjustment clause.
    * The court held that the arbitral award regarding fixed costs was unreasoned and perverse because it awarded damages for the loss of a third party (AMPL) without proper justification or evidence.
    * The court agreed with RVUNL's position on the Escrow Account, finding that PKCL had accepted the deduction policy and that RVUNL, as the mine owner, was responsible for mine closure.
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The court strictly construed the CMDA, emphasizing the importance of adhering to the express terms of the contract.
    * The court applied the principles of public policy, holding that an award must be in accordance with the substantive law and must not be patently illegal.
    * The court interpreted the force majeure clause as not precluding price adjustment for the period covered by the delay.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The court applied the principles of contract interpretation, focusing on the plain language of the CMDA and considering the conduct of the parties.
    * The court applied the principles of damages for breach of contract, finding that the award of fixed costs was not supported by evidence or proper reasoning.
    * The court applied the doctrine of estoppel to the Escrow Account issue, finding that PKCL was bound by its acceptance of the deduction policy.

## 6. Judgment

* **Final Decision:** The Rajasthan High Court allowed the appeal, setting aside both the arbitral award and the order of the Commercial Court. 
* **Relief Granted:** The judgment effectively overturned the arbitral award, relieving RVUNL of the financial obligations imposed by the award.
* **Orders:** The court ordered the setting aside of the arbitral award and the order of the Commercial Court.
