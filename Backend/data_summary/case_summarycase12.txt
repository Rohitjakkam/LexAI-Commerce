**4. Arguments Presented**

* **Applicant’s Argument:**  The Applicant argued that the arbitral proceedings could not be concluded within the time limit specified under Section 29-A(1) and the subsequent extension granted by the parties under Section 29-A(3). Therefore, they sought an extension under Section 29-A(4) and (5).
* **Opposite Party’s Argument:** The Opposite Party did not present specific arguments regarding the jurisdiction of the court in the judgment text provided.

**5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning**

* **Key Findings:** 
    * The court found that the Arbitrator was appointed by the Housing Commissioner and not by the court under Section 11 of the Act, 1996.
    * The court interpreted the definition of "Court" under Section 2(1)(e) of the Act, 1996, as amended in 2016, to mean the Principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction in a District (District Judge's Court) and not the High Court.
    * The Allahabad High Court does not have ordinary original civil jurisdiction to try commercial disputes, which is a requirement for the Commercial Division of the High Court to exercise jurisdiction under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015.
* **Interpretation of Law:** The court interpreted the definition of "Court" under Section 2(1)(e) of the Act, 1996, and concluded that the Allahabad High Court lacked the necessary jurisdiction to extend the time limit under Section 29-A(4) and (5) of the Act, 1996.
* **Application of Law:**  The court applied the interpretation of "Court" and the provisions of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, to determine that the application was not maintainable before the Allahabad High Court.

**6. Judgment**

* **Final Decision:** The application filed by the Applicant under Section 29-A(4) and (5) of the Act, 1996 was dismissed.
* **Relief Granted:** No relief was granted as the application was dismissed.
* **Orders:** The court ordered that the concerned parties or the Arbitrator themselves could approach the "Court," as defined in the judgment, for seeking an extension of the time limit.

**7. Implications**

* **Impact on Law:**  The judgment clarifies the meaning of "Court" under Section 29-A of the Act, 1996, as it relates to non-international commercial arbitrations. It also highlights the jurisdictional limitations of the Allahabad High Court in arbitration matters.
* **Future Relevance:** This judgment serves as a precedent for future cases involving applications for extensions of time limits in non-international commercial arbitrations in the Allahabad High Court.
* **Broader Context:** The case highlights the importance of understanding the jurisdiction of courts in arbitration matters and the need to apply the appropriate legal framework when dealing with such cases.

**8. Summary Points**
