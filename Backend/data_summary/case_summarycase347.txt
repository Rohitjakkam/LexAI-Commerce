    * The Court below erred by calling for the record as it amounts to remanding the matter back to the Arbitral Tribunal, contrary to the Supreme Court's judgment in I-Pay Clearing Services Private Limited vs. ICICI Bank Limited. 
* **Defendant’s Argument (Respondent):**
    * The Commercial Court had only called for the original record and was not passing a remand order, therefore, there was no ground for interference.
    * The Court below would consider the rival submissions after receiving the record from the Arbitral Tribunal.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The Court found that the Commercial Court was trying to decide the application under Section 34 of the Act on its merits and had not actually remanded the matter back to the Arbitral Tribunal.
    * The Court recognized that the Supreme Court in I-Pay Clearing Services Private Limited vs. ICICI Bank Limited had provided guidance on the concept of remand in arbitration proceedings under Section 34(4) of the Act. 
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The Court interpreted Section 34(4) of the Act as allowing the Court to seek relevant records from the Arbitral Tribunal in order to arrive at a final decision on the application under Section 34 of the Act.
    * The Court distinguished the case from those involving a direct remand to the Arbitral Tribunal, finding that the Court below was simply seeking the original record to ensure a fair and informed decision. 
* **Application of Law:**
    * The Court held that the Commercial Court's action of calling for the record was not a remand as defined under Section 34(4) of the Act.
    * The Court emphasized the Commercial Court's intent to decide the application under Section 34 of the Act finally, concluding that the petitioner's argument regarding a remand was misplaced. 

## 6. Judgment

* **Final Decision:** The petition was dismissed.
* **Relief Granted:** No relief was granted to the petitioner.
* **Orders:** The High Court dismissed the petition and upheld the Commercial Court's order to call for the original record.

## 7. Implications
