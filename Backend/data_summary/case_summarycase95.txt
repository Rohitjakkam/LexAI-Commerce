## 1. Case Title

* **Case Name:** Vishal Exports Overseas Limited vs State Bank of India
* **Court:** Gujarat High Court
* **Date of Judgment:** 10 July, 2018
* **Citation:** C/FA/1956/2018

## 2. Background and Context

* **Brief Overview:** Vishal Exports Overseas Limited (the plaintiff) had obtained financial facilities (working capital and term loans) from a consortium of banks led by State Bank of India (the defendant).  Due to financial difficulties, the plaintiff defaulted on its loan obligations. The consortium banks initiated recovery proceedings before the Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT), while the plaintiff filed a civil suit against the consortium banks seeking damages for their alleged wrongful actions. The banks then moved to reject the plaintiff's plaint under Order VII Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, arguing that the suit was barred by the provisions of the Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993 (Finance Act, 1993).
* **Key Issues:**
    * Whether the plaintiff's suit for damages was barred by the Finance Act, 1993, which mandates that debtors file counterclaims in recovery proceedings before the DRT.
    * Whether the plaintiff's conduct in not filing a counterclaim before the DRT disentitled them from pursuing their suit in the civil court.
    * Whether the observations made by the Gujarat High Court in a previous round of litigation (Special Civil Applications No. 7434/2014 to 7445/2014) barred the plaintiff's suit.

## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Plaintiff’s Argument:**
    * The plaintiff argued that the Finance Act, 1993, did not bar them from filing an independent suit for damages.
    * They asserted that they had a separate and independent cause of action for damages, which was not a mere counterclaim to the banks' recovery proceedings.
    * They contended that filing a counterclaim in each of the six separate DRT applications was impractical due to the joint and several liability of the consortium banks.
    * They relied on Supreme Court precedents, arguing that an independent suit by a borrower for damages was generally permissible.
    * They emphasized that the previous High Court orders did not bar their independent suit.
    * They argued that transferring the suit to the DRT would be futile since the DRT proceedings had already concluded.
* **Defendant’s Argument:**
    * The defendant argued that the plaintiff was required to file a counterclaim in the recovery proceedings before the DRT, as provided under Section 19 of the Finance Act, 1993.
    * They contended that the plaintiff's independent suit was an abuse of the court process.
    * They relied on the observations made by the High Court in the previous round of litigation.
    * They cited the Supreme Court's decision in Bank of Rajasthan Limited v. VCK Shares and Stock Broking Services Limited, where the court referred to a larger bench the question of whether an independent suit by a borrower is maintainable or should be transferred to the DRT.
    * They asserted that the plaintiff's conduct in not filing a counterclaim disentitled them from pursuing the suit.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The court noted that the trial court had heavily relied on the previous High Court orders, but those orders did not specifically bar the plaintiff's suit.
    * The court observed that the trial court had not made a specific finding that the plaintiff's suit was barred by any law.
    * The court recognized that the Supreme Court precedents cited by the plaintiff generally allowed for independent suits by borrowers, although the issue of transfer to the DRT was pending before a larger bench.
    * The court acknowledged that the plaintiff's failure to file a counterclaim might have been a tactical decision, but it did not constitute a bar to their suit.
    * The court considered that transferring the suit to the DRT was now impractical due to the conclusion of the DRT proceedings.
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The court interpreted Order VII Rule 11 of the CPC as requiring a specific finding that a suit is barred by law before it can be rejected.
    * The court interpreted Section 19 of the Finance Act, 1993, as providing a remedy for debtors to file counterclaims but not as barring independent suits for damages.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The court applied the principles of Order VII Rule 11 of the CPC and found that the trial court had not met the requirements for rejecting the plaint.
    * The court found that the plaintiff's suit was not barred by the Finance Act, 1993, and that the previous High Court orders did not constitute a bar to their suit.
    * The court considered the practicalities of transferring the suit to the DRT and found it to be inappropriate in this case.

## 6. Judgment

* **Final Decision:** The Gujarat High Court allowed the plaintiff's appeal.
* **Relief Granted:** The court quashed and set aside the trial court's order rejecting the plaintiff's plaint. The case was ordered to be restored to the file of the Commercial Court, City Civil Court, Ahmedabad, for determination on its merits.
* **Orders:** The court directed the Commercial Court to proceed with the suit in accordance with law.

## 7. Implications

* **Impact on Law:** The judgment clarifies that a plaint cannot be rejected under Order VII Rule 11 of the CPC without a specific finding that the suit is barred by any law.
* **Future Relevance:** The judgment may provide guidance for future cases where borrowers seek to file independent suits for damages against lenders who have initiated recovery proceedings.
* **Broader Context:** The case highlights the complexities of debt recovery proceedings and the interplay between the Finance Act, 1993, and the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.
