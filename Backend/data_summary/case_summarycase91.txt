## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Appellant's Argument:**
    * The bank guarantees were unconditional and irrevocable, giving the Appellant the right to invoke them without protest.
    * The Appellant was entitled to invoke the bank guarantees for any loss or damages suffered due to the defective cables.
    * The Respondent's application for injunction was rendered infructuous because the bank guarantees were already invoked.
    * The Commercial Court erred in applying Section 9(ii)(b) of the Act and failing to consider the principles of Order XXXVIII Rule 5, CPC.
    * The Commercial Court improperly considered Section 9(ii)(e) as a residuary power and failed to apply the "just and convenient" standard correctly. 
    * The dispute related to the quality of cables under one Purchase Order, not the entire contract, and therefore the invocation of all bank guarantees was justified.
    * The Appellant's claims of damages due to defective cables were legitimate and needed to be adjudicated by the arbitral tribunal.

* **Respondent's Argument:**
    * The Commercial Court correctly exercised its powers under Section 9(ii)(d) and (e) of the Act to protect the Respondent's interests.
    * The Appellant improperly invoked all bank guarantees, including those unrelated to the alleged cable defects, which was an unjust and disproportionate response.
    * The Appellant's claims of damages were baseless and afterthought, and should be proven before the arbitral tribunal.
    * The Appellant's failure to pay the outstanding amount due to the Respondent justified the interim measures.
    * The Commercial Court's order was a fair balancing of equities between the parties, and the Respondent would suffer irreparable harm if not protected. 
    * The Commercial Court's decision was within the scope of Section 94 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which provides for supplementary proceedings.

## 5. Courtâ€™s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
