* **Key Issues:**
    *  Whether the Respondent was entitled to claim prior user of "SUPERON" from 1994 through its sister concern, Stanvac Chemicals India Ltd., despite its own incorporation in 2004. 
    *  Whether the proposed amendment by the Respondent, changing the date of user for "SUPERON," substantially altered the nature of the suit.
    *  Whether the learned Joint Registrar acted within his jurisdiction in adjudicating the Respondent's application for amendment.
