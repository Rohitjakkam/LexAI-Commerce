## Courtâ€™s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The Court found that the Commercial Court had not been established in the District.
    * The Court interpreted the provision of Section 7 of the Commercial Courts Act to mean that suits filed in the Original Side of the High Court, which should have been filed in the District Court, would not be transferred to the Commercial Court.

    * The Court also found that the Petitioner was not rendered remediless due to the lack of a constituted Commercial Court.

* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The Court interpreted Section 7 of the Act narrowly, focusing on suits filed in the Original Side of the High Court. 
    * The Court interpreted Section 15(2) of the Act to mean that suits which had reached the stage of final judgment would not be transferred to the Commercial Court.
    * The Court emphasized that the provision of Section 15(2) meant that the Civil Court had jurisdiction to entertain and try the suit until the Commercial Court was constituted.

* **Application of Law:** 
    * The Court applied the principles of forum non conveniens and the doctrine of res judicata in interpreting the applicable provisions of the Commercial Courts Act.
    * The Court emphasized the principles of natural justice and avoided rendering the Petitioner remediless due to the inaction of the State in establishing the Commercial Court.
