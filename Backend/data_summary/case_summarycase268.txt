## Case Title

* **Case Name:** Shreedatt Dash vs. M/S. Z. Estate Private Ltd. (Zepl) 
* **Court:** Orissa High Court
* **Date of Judgment:** 30th May 2023
* **Citation:** CMP No.1193 of 2022 (Orissa High Court)

## Background and Context

**Brief Overview:** 

The case revolves around a dispute between Shreedatt Dash (Plaintiff/Petitioner) and M/s. Z. Estate Private Ltd. (ZEPL) (Defendant/Opposite Party No.1) concerning two flats purchased by Shreedatt Dash's parents from ZEPL. After the death of his parents, a dispute arose between Shreedatt Dash and his siblings regarding the ownership of the flats.  ZEPL cancelled the agreement with Shreedatt Dash's parents alleging non-payment of outstanding dues.  Shreedatt Dash then filed a civil suit seeking a declaration that the cancellation was invalid and an injunction preventing ZEPL from transferring the flats to a third party.  ZEPL filed for arbitration under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (Arbitration Act), but the Senior Civil Judge, Khurda rejected their application. ZEPL appealed the decision, and the District Judge transferred the appeal to the Senior Civil Judge (Commercial Court) in Bhubaneswar.  Shreedatt Dash challenged the transfer, arguing that the Commercial Court lacked jurisdiction.

## Arguments Presented

**Plaintiff’s Argument:**

* The Commercial Court lacked jurisdiction to hear the appeal under Section 37(1)(a) of the Arbitration Act.
* The appeal should have been heard by the District Judge, designated as a Commercial Appellate Court under the CC Act.
* The transfer of the appeal to the Commercial Court was inconsistent with the legislative mandate of the Arbitration Act and the CC Act.
* The dispute did not meet the "Specified Value" criteria for a commercial dispute under the CC Act. 

**Defendant’s Argument:**

* The Commercial Court had jurisdiction to hear the appeal as per Section 10(1) of the CC Act.
* The precedents in M/s M.G. Mohanty (supra) and Jaycee Housing Private Limited (supra) clearly established the jurisdiction of the Commercial Court in arbitration matters.
* The dispute was a "commercial dispute of a Specified Value" and therefore fell under the purview of the CC Act.

## Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

**Key Findings:**

* The court recognized that the establishment of Commercial Courts under the CC Act was intended to expedite the resolution of commercial disputes, including those arising from arbitration.
* The court emphasized the need for harmonious construction of the Arbitration Act and the CC Act, to avoid conflicting interpretations and ensure a smooth workflow in the justice system.
* The court concluded that the CC Act, as a later enactment, should prevail over the Arbitration Act in matters of procedural law.
* The court determined that the dispute involved a "commercial dispute of a Specified Value," as defined by the CC Act, based on the market value of the flats involved.

**Interpretation of Law:**

* The court interpreted Section 10 of the CC Act to signify that all applications and appeals arising out of an arbitration concerning a "commercial dispute of a Specified Value" should be filed in and heard by the Commercial Court.
* The court interpreted Section 15 of the CC Act to include the transfer of pending appeals from the Principal Civil Court of the District to the Commercial Court, despite the lack of explicit mention in the provision.

**Application of Law:**

* The court applied the principle of retrospective application of procedural law to conclude that the appeal, though initiated before the establishment of the Commercial Court, should be transferred to the Commercial Court.
* The court applied the "Specified Value" criteria of the CC Act to determine that the dispute involved a commercial dispute, based on the market value of the flats.
* The court rejected the Plaintiff's reliance on the case law in M/s Beta Exim Logistics (P) Ltd. (supra), finding it inapplicable to the present scenario.

## Judgment

**Final Decision:**

* The court ruled in favor of the Defendant and dismissed the Petitioner's CMP (Civil Miscellaneous Petition).

**Relief Granted:**

**Orders:**

* The court ordered the dismissal of the CMP, with no order as to costs.
