## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Plaintiff's Argument (At-Libra):**
    * BCCL wrongfully terminated the contract and refused to provide a work schedule for the extended period, constituting a breach of contract.
    * The non-supply of the work schedule hindered At-Libra's ability to complete the contract, resulting in loss of profit and other expenses.
    * The bank guarantee was illegally encashed without justification or notice to At-Libra.
    * At-Libra is entitled to damages, including loss of profit, EMI payments on equipment, refund of the bank guarantee, interest on withheld funds, service tax reimbursement, and reimbursement for differential wages. 
* **Defendant's Argument (BCCL):**
    * At-Libra failed to complete the work within the stipulated time, even after the extended period.
    * At-Libra did not submit a transportation schedule, which was a condition precedent for issuing a work schedule.
    * BCCL was justified in terminating the contract and encashing the bank guarantee due to At-Libra's default.
    * At-Libra's claims are exaggerated and unsupported by evidence.
    * The trial court erred in awarding interest at 10.5% p.a., which is not in accordance with the Commercial Courts Act or the Interest Act.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The court found that the non-supply of a work schedule for the extended contract period by BCCL amounted to a breach of contract.
    * The work schedule is an essential component of the contract, linked to the measurement of work, payment, and penalties.
    * The court rejected BCCL's contention that the transportation schedule was a condition precedent for issuing the work schedule, finding that the transportation schedule was a continuous requirement throughout the contract and was already provided by At-Libra.
    * The court determined that BCCL's termination of the contract was unjustified and amounted to a cover-up for their breach of contract by not providing the work schedule.
    * The court found that BCCL's encashment of the bank guarantee was illegal and malafide, as At-Libra was not in default and was not given any opportunity to present its case.
    * The court acknowledged that At-Libra was not in breach of contract and was ready to resume work upon receiving the work schedule, but BCCL intentionally withheld the work schedule to create a situation where At-Libra could not complete the contract.
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The court interpreted the contract language and determined that the work schedule was a fundamental requirement for the execution and completion of the contract, even during the extended period.
    * The court interpreted the provisions of the Commercial Courts Act, finding that its scope for interference is limited to perversity of findings and not a full-fledged re-appreciation of evidence as in a regular first appeal under the CPC.
    * The court interpreted the provisions of the CPC, Order VIII Rule 3-A, regarding specific denials, finding that BCCL's failure to specifically deny the requirement of a work schedule amounted to admission.
    * The court interpreted the provisions of the CPC, Order XI, regarding admission and denial of documents, finding that BCCL's failure to deny the genuineness of documents submitted by At-Libra amounted to admission.
    * The court interpreted the provisions of the Interest Act and the CPC, Order VII, regarding the interest rate, finding that the provisions are directory and not mandatory.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The court applied the principles of breach of contract to BCCL's actions, finding that their failure to provide the work schedule constituted a breach of the reciprocal promises in the contract.
    * The court applied the principles of damages for breach of contract, awarding compensation to At-Libra for their loss of profit and other incurred expenses.
    * The court applied the principles of estoppel, waiver, and acquiescence, finding that BCCL could not raise new arguments regarding the transportation schedule at the appellate stage.
    * The court applied the principle of perversity, finding that the trial court's decision was not based on no evidence or unreliable evidence and was actively considered.
    * The court applied the principle of mandatory vs. directory provisions, finding that the provisions regarding the interest rate were directory and the trial court's award of interest was justified.
