## 4. Arguments Presented

•	Plaintiff’s Argument:
    - The defendant's "SHUDDH by TATA salt" packaging is a colourable imitation of the plaintiff's "AASHIRVAAD salt" packaging, leading to confusion among consumers.
    - The defendant's actions constitute infringement of the plaintiff's registered trademark and passing off.
    - The defendant is intentionally trying to capitalize on the goodwill and reputation of the plaintiff's "AASHIRVAAD salt" brand.
    - The plaintiff is suffering irreparable damage and requires immediate injunction to prevent further infringement and passing off.
    - Section 12-A of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 does not apply in this case because the plaintiff needs urgent interim relief.
•	Defendant’s Argument:
    - The defendant's packaging is not deceptively similar to the plaintiff's packaging and does not infringe their trademark.
    - The plaintiff failed to comply with Section 12-A of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 by not availing pre-institution mediation before filing the suit, rendering the suit non-maintainable.
