## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Plaintiff’s Argument:**
    * The plaintiff claimed to be the registered proprietor of the word mark "Express" Electro Elevators with an e-logo, registered in Class 7 and 37 for manufacturing and services of elevators, lifts, and escalators.
    * The plaintiff argued that the disclaimer clause in the registration certificate applied only to the descriptive elements of the mark and not to the word "Express," which was prominently displayed.
    * The plaintiff claimed to be the prior user of the word "Express" in the relevant business since 1999, establishing significant goodwill and reputation.
    * The plaintiff asserted that the defendants' use of the word "Express" in their trademark and promotional materials constituted trademark infringement and passing off.
    * The plaintiff argued that the defendants' use of "Express" would cause confusion among consumers and harm the plaintiff's reputation.
    * The plaintiff countered the defendants' arguments about delay and laches, arguing that the plaintiff's rights as a registered trademark holder and prior user warranted injunctive relief.
* **Defendant’s Argument:**
    * The defendants highlighted the disclaimer clause in the plaintiff's registration certificate, arguing that it prohibited the plaintiff from claiming exclusive rights to the descriptive matter, including the word "Express."
    * The defendants argued that the plaintiff had not applied for separate registration of the word "Express," implying a lack of exclusive rights to its use.
    * The defendants presented evidence of their use of the word "Express" in their business since 1995, challenging the plaintiff's claim of prior user.
    * The defendants argued that the word "Express" is a generic term, widely used in the industry to denote speed and efficiency, and therefore not eligible for exclusive trademark protection.
    * The defendants emphasized the common usage of the word "Express" in various contexts and by numerous other businesses, negating the plaintiff's claim of distinctiveness.
    * The defendants contended that the plaintiff's case lacked merit, particularly regarding the passing off claim, as consumers in the relevant industry were sophisticated and unlikely to be misled.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The court found that the plaintiff's trademark registration, which included the word "Express," was for a device mark and a word mark as a whole, with a disclaimer clause prohibiting exclusive use of the descriptive matter. 
    * The court determined that the plaintiff had not applied for separate registration of the word "Express," meaning the plaintiff did not have exclusive rights to its use.
    * The court emphasized that the word "Express" is a common term with dictionary meaning, indicating speed and efficiency, and is widely used in various industries.
    * The court acknowledged that the plaintiff's registration certificate stated that it had used the word "Express" since 1999. However, it found that the defendants' use of the word since 1995 contradicted this claim of prior user.
    * The court considered the sophisticated nature of the target audience for lifts, elevators, and escalators, concluding that confusion among consumers was unlikely.
    * The court recognized the defendants' evidence of using the word "Express" in their trademark and promotional materials since 1995.
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The court thoroughly analyzed relevant provisions of the Trademark Act, particularly sections 9, 15, and 17, relating to generic terms, registration of parts of trademarks, and the effect of registration.
    * The court interpreted the disclaimer clause in the plaintiff's registration certificate as a clear indication that the plaintiff did not possess exclusive rights to the word "Express."
    * The court applied legal principles of trademark infringement and passing off, considering factors such as prior user, distinctiveness, and likelihood of confusion.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The court found that the plaintiff's claim of exclusive rights to the word "Express" was not supported by the registration certificate or by applicable trademark law.
    * The court determined that the plaintiff had not proven to be the prior user of the word "Express" in the relevant market.
    * The court concluded that the defendants' use of the word "Express" did not constitute trademark infringement or passing off. 
    * The court considered precedents cited by both parties and applied their rationale to the facts of the case.

## 6. Judgment

* **Final Decision:** The Gujarat High Court rejected all appeals from order, confirming the Commercial Court's decision to dismiss the plaintiff's injunction applications.
* **Relief Granted:** No relief was granted to the plaintiff.
* **Orders:** The impugned orders passed by the Commercial Court were confirmed, and any interim relief granted earlier was vacated.

## 7. Implications

* **Impact on Law:** The judgment reaffirms the importance of a clear disclaimer clause in trademark registrations, particularly when generic terms are used as part of the mark.
* **Future Relevance:** The case highlights the need for businesses to carefully consider the distinctiveness of their trademarks and the potential for confusion with existing marks. The judgment underscores the need for clear evidence to establish prior user in passing off claims.
* **Broader Context:** The case demonstrates the ongoing challenge of balancing the rights of trademark holders with the need to allow businesses to use common terms in their marketing. The judgment emphasizes the importance of carefully navigating trademark law and seeking proper legal advice when developing and registering trademarks.

## 8. Summary Points

* The plaintiff failed to prove that it was the prior user of the word "Express" in the relevant market.
* The court found that the word "Express" is a common term with no distinctiveness, making it ineligible for trademark protection.
* The court concluded that the defendants' use of the word "Express" did not constitute trademark infringement or passing off.
