* **Court:** Madras High Court
* **Date of Judgment:** 26th September 2019
* **Citation:** O.S.A.No.107/2019

## 2. Background and Context

* **Brief Overview:** This case involved a dispute between two construction companies, M/s.Indus Cityscapes Constructions Pvt.Ltd. (Appellant) and M/s.Karismaa Foundations Pvt.Ltd. (Respondent). The dispute arose from a turnkey construction contract entered into in 2009, where the Respondent agreed to construct a multi-storeyed residential complex for the Appellant.  After completing the work, the Respondent raised a final invoice for Rs. 86,42,840/- (including service tax) in 2013. The Appellant paid the service tax portion but failed to pay the remaining amount, leading to the legal proceedings.
* **Key Issues:**
    * Whether the Appellant's payment of service tax constituted an admission of liability for the remaining amount due.
    * Whether the court could grant judgment on admission under Order XII Rule 6 of the CPC when a prior suit (C.S.No.59 of 2018) was pending between the parties.
    * Whether the provisions of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 applied to the case.

## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Appellant’s Argument:**
    * The Appellant argued that the payment of service tax did not constitute an admission of liability for the remaining amount due.
    * The Appellant pointed out the pendency of a prior suit (C.S.No.59 of 2018) and argued that both suits should be heard together.
    * The Appellant also claimed that there were further amounts due from the Respondent for excess payments and damages due to incomplete work and delays.
    * The Appellant argued that invoking Order XII Rule 6 of CPC was inappropriate as there were genuine disputes that needed to be resolved through a trial.
* **Respondent’s Argument:**
    * The Respondent argued that the payment of service tax and the acceptance of the final invoice constituted an admission of liability.
    * The Respondent stated that the pending suit (C.S.No.59 of 2018) was merely a delaying tactic.
    * The Respondent contended that Order XII Rule 6 was applicable as there was a clear admission of liability and that the pending suit did not negate this.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The court found that the provisions of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 did not prohibit the Respondent from continuing with the suit as it was a suit "by" a corporate debtor and not "against" one.
    * The court acknowledged the pendency of the prior suit (C.S.No.59 of 2018) and recognized the potential for conflicting judgments if both suits were tried separately.
    * The court held that while the payment of service tax might be interpreted as tacit admission of liability, it was not conclusive and needed further explanation during a trial.
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The court thoroughly examined the provisions of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 and Order XIII-A of the CPC, finding that the Act provided a comprehensive framework for commercial disputes, including provisions for summary judgment.
    * The court analyzed the provisions of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, concluding that the moratorium provisions only applied to proceedings "against" a corporate debtor, not those initiated by them.
    * The court reviewed the precedents cited by both parties, finding that while Order XII Rule 6 could be used for summary judgment based on admissions, it should not be used when there were genuine disputes or when a prior suit was pending that could lead to conflicting judgments.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The court applied the provisions of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 and Order XIII-A of the CPC, determining that the Act had effectively superseded Order XII Rule 6 of the CPC for commercial disputes.
    * The court considered the specific facts of the case and concluded that while the Respondent's arguments regarding admission of liability had some merit, the case required further investigation through a trial. 

## 6. Judgment

* **Final Decision:** The court modified the impugned order of the Single Judge, partly allowing the appeal.
* **Relief Granted:**
    * The Appellant was directed to deposit the balance of the amount ordered by the Single Judge to the credit of C.S.No.632 of 2018 within six weeks.
    * Both suits (C.S.No.59 of 2018 and C.S.No.632 of 2018) were ordered to be listed together for final disposal according to the provisions of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015.
* **Orders:**
    * The impugned order was modified to allow a joint trial of both suits.
    * The appeal was partly allowed, and the connected Miscellaneous Petitions were closed.

## 7. Implications

* **Impact on Law:**
    * The judgment clarifies the application of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 in relation to Order XII Rule 6 of the CPC.
    * The judgment reinforces the principle that summary judgment should be granted cautiously, particularly when there are genuine disputes or pending suits that may lead to conflicting judgments.
* **Future Relevance:**
    * The judgment provides guidance for future cases involving commercial disputes and the use of Order XII Rule 6 of the CPC.
    * It also emphasizes the importance of considering the provisions of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 in relevant situations.
* **Broader Context:**
    * The judgment highlights the need for efficient and expeditious resolution of commercial disputes.
    * It underscores the importance of ensuring fairness and due process for all parties involved in legal proceedings.

## 8. Summary Points

* The Madras High Court ruled that the Appellant's payment of service tax did not definitively constitute an admission of liability for the remaining amount due.
* The court concluded that Order XII Rule 6 of the CPC was not applicable in this case due to the pendency of a prior suit and the availability of a comprehensive framework for commercial disputes under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015.
* The court ordered a joint trial for both suits and directed the Appellant to deposit the remaining amount to facilitate a fair resolution of the dispute.
