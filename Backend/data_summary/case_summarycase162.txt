    * **Rule of Casus Omissus:** The court considered the possibility of a casus omissus (an omission) but ultimately relied on the literal interpretation.

## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Plaintiff's Argument:** 
    * The plaintiff's counsel argued that the amendments introduced by the Commercial Courts Act should apply to all "commercial disputes", regardless of the Specified Value. 
    * The counsel relied on the Preamble, Section 4, Section 7, and the Schedule to the Commercial Courts Act to support this interpretation. 
    * He asserted that the intent behind the Act was to expedite the resolution of commercial disputes, and applying the amendments selectively would lead to absurdity and undermine the Act's purpose. 
    * He also argued that the lack of reference to "Specified Value" in the Schedule and marginal note/heading to Section 16 indicated the legislature's intention for the amendments to apply to all commercial disputes.
    * Further, the plaintiff's counsel highlighted the practical consequences of applying the amendments selectively, which would create a backlog in the Commercial Division, contradicting the Act's objective.
* **Defendant's Argument:**
    * The defendant's counsel argued that the amendments introduced by the Commercial Courts Act only applied to "commercial disputes of a Specified Value."
    * He argued for a literal interpretation of Section 16 of the Commercial Courts Act, emphasizing the phrase "in their application to any suit in respect of a commercial dispute of a Specified Value."
    * The defendant's counsel relied on various precedents to support the literal rule of interpretation.
    * He further argued that the whole scheme of the Commercial Courts Act linked commercial disputes with Specified Value, and the plaintiff's valuation of the suit at Rs. 20,000/- indicated that it was not a Specified Value dispute. 

## 5. Court's Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:** 
    * The court acknowledged that the marginal note/heading to Section 16 could not control the plain meaning of the section. 
    * The court also found that the expressions in the Schedule to the Commercial Courts Act could not prevail against the express enactment.
    * The court recognized the potential for absurdity and inconvenience if the amendments were applied selectively, but it felt bound by the literal interpretation of Section 16.
* **Interpretation of Law:** 
    * The court emphasized the plain language of Section 16 and interpreted the phrase "commercial disputes of a Specified Value" literally. 
    * The court found no ambiguity in the language of Section 16 and did not find sufficient grounds to depart from the literal interpretation.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The court applied the literal interpretation of Section 16 to the facts of the case, concluding that the amendments introduced to the CPC by the Commercial Courts Act only applied to commercial disputes of a Specified Value.
    * Therefore, the mandatory period of 120 days for filing a written statement under the Commercial Courts Act did not apply to the suit, as it was not a Specified Value dispute.

## 6. Judgment

* **Final Decision:** The court ruled in favor of the petitioner (Leitz Tooling Systems India Pvt. Ltd.)
* **Relief Granted:** The court condoned the delay of two days in filing the written statement in the suit and disposed of the Notice of Motion.
* **Orders:** The court concluded that the amendments introduced to the CPC by the Commercial Courts Act only applied to Commercial Disputes of a Specified Value and not Commercial Disputes not of a Specified Value.

## 7. Implications

* **Impact on Law:** The judgment clarified the scope of the amendments introduced by the Commercial Courts Act, confirming that they only apply to commercial disputes of a Specified Value. 
* **Future Relevance:** This judgment provides guidance for future cases involving the interpretation of Section 16 of the Commercial Courts Act. 
* **Broader Context:** The judgment highlights the importance of adhering to the literal rule of interpretation when the language of a statute is clear. It also underscores the potential challenges in applying the Commercial Courts Act in situations where the value of a commercial dispute falls below the Specified Value threshold.

## 8. Summary Points

* The amendments introduced to the CPC by the Commercial Courts Act only apply to commercial disputes with a value exceeding Rupees Three Lacs (Specified Value).
* The court interpreted Section 16 of the Commercial Courts Act literally and did not depart from the plain meaning of the language.
* The court's decision has implications for future cases involving the application of the Commercial Courts Act to commercial disputes below the Specified Value.
