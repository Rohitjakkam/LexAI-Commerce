    * The Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (CPC), specifically:
        * Order VII Rule 10 (Return of plaint)
        * Order VII Rule 11 (Rejection of plaint)
    * The Commercial Courts Act, 2015, specifically:
        * Section 15(2) (Transfer of pending cases to Commercial Court)
* **Precedents Cited:**

* **Legal Doctrines:**
    * **Article 141 of the Constitution of India:** Declaration of the law by the Supreme Court.
    * **Principle of "Ipso facto":** Implying that any action taken outside the specified method is automatically invalid.

**4. Arguments Presented**

* **Petitioner's Argument (Virender Kumar):**
    * The suit filed by Rekha Bhayana was a commercial suit incorrectly filed in a Civil Court. 
    * Relying on the Supreme Court decision in Ambalal Sarabhai Enterprises, he argued that the plaint should be returned to the respondent for proper filing in a Commercial Court under Order VII Rule 10 of the CPC. 
    * He claimed that Section 15(2) of the Commercial Courts Act does not permit transferring commercial suits filed in the wrong court as a matter of course.
* **Respondent's Argument (Rekha Bhayana):**
    * Rekha Bhayana's Counsel admitted that the suit was a commercial suit, but argued against returning the plaint.
    * They relied on:
        * Circulars issued by the Principal District Judge (Rohini) and Pr. DSJ (North-West District) Rohini.
        * The decision in Hari Singh v. M.S. Superhouse Ltd.
        * Section 15(2) of the Commercial Courts Act.
    * They argued that Ambalal Sarabhai Enterprises was distinguishable as it involved a non-commercial suit filed in a Commercial Court, not the reverse.

**5. Courtâ€™s Analysis and Reasoning**

* **Key Findings:**
    * The Court disagreed with the Commercial Court's reliance on administrative circulars as they cannot override the CPC or Supreme Court decisions.
    * The court held that the principle established in Ambalal Sarabhai Enterprises applies equally to cases where a commercial suit is wrongly filed in a Civil Court.
    * The court interpreted Section 15(2) of the Commercial Courts Act as applying only to commercial suits pending at the time the Act came into force, not future cases.
    * The Court recognized that commercial suits have a distinct protocol and format, requiring greater rigour than non-commercial suits. 
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The Court interpreted Order VII Rule 10 of the CPC as clearly requiring a plaint filed in the wrong court to be returned to the plaintiff.
    * The court emphasized that allowing commercial suits filed in Civil Courts to be transferred to Commercial Courts would be counterproductive and inconsistent with the specific provisions and procedures established for commercial suits.
    * The Court rejected the distinction proposed by the Commercial Court between Ambalal Sarabhai Enterprises and the current case, finding the principle of returning the plaint applicable in both situations.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The court applied the legal principles established in Ambalal Sarabhai Enterprises and Order VII Rule 10 of the CPC to the specific case before it.
    * The Court concluded that the plaint should be returned to Rekha Bhayana to be properly instituted in a Commercial Court, following the correct procedures and format.

**6. Judgment**
