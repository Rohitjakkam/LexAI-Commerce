* **Court:** Jharkhand High Court
* **Date of Judgment:** 24th June, 2020
* **Citation:** W.P. (C). No. 3941 of 2019 

## 2. Background and Context

* **Brief Overview:** Daimler Financial Services India Pvt. Limited. (Daimler), a non-banking finance company, had lent money to Vikash Kumar and Vikram Kumar. When the loan was not repaid, Daimler initiated arbitration proceedings, leading to an award in their favor. Daimler then filed for execution of this award in the Commercial Court, Dhanbad.

* **Key Issues:** 
    *  Whether the Commercial Court, Dhanbad, had the requisite pecuniary jurisdiction to execute the award under the amended Commercial Courts Act, 2015.
    *  Whether the petitioner (Daimler) was entitled to execution of the award, despite the respondents' arguments about the alleged forceful repossession of the vehicle.

## 3. Legal Principles Involved

* **Relevant Statutes and Provisions:**
    * The Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Act, 2015 (amended by The Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts (Amendment) Act, 2018 (28 of 2018))
    * Section 3(1-A) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015
    * Section 2(1)(i) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 
    * Section 12 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015
* **Precedents Cited:**
    * Vijay Cotton And Fiber Company vs. Agarwal Cotton Spinning Pvt. Ltd. (Gujarat High Court, 11.02.2019)
    * Radhey Shyam & Anr. vs. Chhabi Nath & Ors. (2015) 5 SCC 423
* **Legal Doctrines:**
    * Retroactive Effect of Legislation: The court examined the applicability of the amendment to the Commercial Courts Act with retrospective effect.
    * Statutory Interpretation: The court analyzed the interplay between various provisions of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, specifically concerning the "specified value" and the jurisdiction of the Commercial Court.
    * Judicial Review: The court considered whether the impugned order of the Commercial Court, Dhanbad, was amenable to judicial review under Article 227 of the Constitution of India.

## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Petitioner's Argument:** 
    * The amendment to the Commercial Courts Act, 2018, with retrospective effect from 03.05.2018, reduced the "specified value" for commercial courts to a minimum of INR 3 lakhs.
    *  The Central Government's notification publishing the amendment effectively set the "specified value" for all purposes at INR 3 lakhs or more. 
    * The State Government's absence of a notification under Section 3(1-A) meant that the Commercial Court, Dhanbad, retained a "specified value" of at least INR 3 lakhs. 
    * The execution petition, therefore, fell within the pecuniary jurisdiction of the Commercial Court, Dhanbad.
    * The petitioner cited the judgments of the Gujarat High Court and the Supreme Court to support their arguments regarding the interpretation of the amended Act and the applicability of Article 227 of the Constitution.
* **Respondent's Argument:**
    * The Commercial Court, Dhanbad, correctly dismissed the execution petition, as it lacked the required pecuniary jurisdiction. 
    * The petitioner's conduct was not fair, as they had forcefully repossessed the vehicle in Bihar while it was still registered in the respondent's name.
    * The execution petition was without merit.

## 5. Court's Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**

    * The court interpreted Section 2(1)(i) and Section 3(1-A) together, concluding that the Central Government's notification publishing the amendment effectively established a "specified value" of INR 3 lakhs or more for all commercial courts. 
    * The court ruled that, in the absence of a specific notification by the State Government, the "specified value" for the Commercial Court, Dhanbad, remained at INR 3 lakhs or more.
* **Interpretation of Law:** 
    * The court carefully interpreted the provisions of the amended Commercial Courts Act, 2018, highlighting the impact of the retrospective effect on the "specified value." 
    * The court reconciled the seemingly conflicting provisions of Section 2(1)(i) and Section 3(1-A) by emphasizing the Central Government's notification as a key factor in establishing the "specified value."
* **Application of Law:**
    * The court applied the legal principles of statutory interpretation and the retrospective effect of legislation to determine the pecuniary jurisdiction of the Commercial Court, Dhanbad. 
    * The court relied on the precedent of the Gujarat High Court, acknowledging the relevance of the "specified value" in the absence of a specific notification by the State Government.
