    * **Right of Appeal:** The court explores the nature of the right to appeal, whether it is procedural or substantive, and whether it can be extinguished by legislation.

## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Plaintiff’s Argument (IDBI):** 
    * The guarantee agreement was a separate transaction from the other transactions involving FDI and was not affected by their potential illegality.
    * The guarantee agreement was severable from the other transactions.
    * The loan from DIIPL to Rubix was a regular Indian Rupee loan, not subject to FDI rules.
    * Hubtown is liable under the guarantee for the debts owed by Rubix.
* **Defendant’s Argument (Hubtown):** 
    * The guarantee agreement was part of a larger, illegal structuring of FDI through Vinca.
    * The DIIPL loan was part of this illegal structure and not severable from it.
    * The transactions were interconnected and not separate.
    * The guarantee agreement was therefore unenforceable as it was part of an illegal scheme.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:** 
    * The court found that the Commercial Appeal filed by Hubtown was maintainable under the Commercial Courts Act.
    * The court found that the issue of severability of the guarantee agreement was a triable issue and required further evidence.
    * The court held that the earlier finding by a single judge (S.J. Kathawalla) that the transactions were inseverable was relevant and could not be disregarded in the present case.
    * The court found that the arguments presented by Hubtown raised triable issues that required adjudication.
    * The court did not find the conditions imposed by the single judge (S.J. Kathawalla) on granting leave to defend to be justified.
* **Interpretation of Law:** 
    * The court interpreted the Commercial Courts Act, particularly Section 13, to permit appeals against decisions, judgments, and orders of the Commercial Division, including those related to summary suits.
    * The court interpreted Order XXXVII of the CPC to apply to summary suits even after their transfer to the Commercial Division.
    * The court interpreted the principle of severability of contracts as applicable to the case, requiring further evidence to determine whether the guarantee was severable. 
* **Application of Law:** 
    * The court applied the principles laid down in various precedents, including cases on interpretation of documents, severability, public policy, and the right of appeal, to the facts of the case.
    * The court considered the arguments and the findings of the earlier single judge (S.J. Kathawalla) and found that they were relevant to the current dispute.
