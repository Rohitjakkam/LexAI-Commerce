## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Plaintiff's Argument:**
    * The respondent was clandestinely selling its infringing products within the jurisdiction of the Delhi High Court.
    * The respondent was advertising and selling its products within the jurisdiction of the court through its online presence.
    * The respondent was carrying on business activities in Delhi.
    * The plaintiff sought urgent interim reliefs due to the alleged infringement and potential damage to his business.
* **Defendant's Argument:**
    * The plaintiff had failed to establish a prima facie case for territorial jurisdiction.
    * The plaintiff had not provided sufficient evidence of the respondent's clandestine sales within Delhi.
    * The plaintiff's claims about the respondent's online presence and business activities in Delhi were not substantiated.
    * The plaintiff's claim of urgent relief was not justified, and he should have followed the pre-institution mediation process under Section 12A of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015.

## 5. Courtâ€™s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The court accepted the plaintiff's averments as true for the purposes of considering the application under Order VII Rule 10 of the CPC (territorial jurisdiction). 
    * The court found that the plaintiff had alleged sufficient facts in the plaint to establish a prima facie case for territorial jurisdiction, despite lacking concrete proof of clandestine sales.
    * The court held that the plaintiff's claim of urgent interim relief was sufficient to exempt him from the pre-institution mediation requirement under Section 12A of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015.
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The court reiterated the well-established principle that in a demurrer, the court must assume the truth of the averments in the plaint. 
    * The court interpreted Section 12A of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 as being mandatory for cases that do not involve urgent interim relief but not applicable to cases that do.
    * The court rejected the respondent's argument that the plaintiff should have filed a separate application for exemption from pre-institution mediation, as there is no such provision in the Act.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The court applied the principle of demurrer to find that the plaintiff's averments in the plaint, if accepted as true, established a prima facie case for territorial jurisdiction.
    * The court applied the language of Section 12A of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 to conclude that the plaintiff was not required to undergo pre-institution mediation because he sought urgent interim relief.

## 6. Judgment

* **Final Decision:** The appeal was allowed. The impugned order of the Commercial Court, directing the return of the plaint, was set aside.
* **Relief Granted:**  The plaintiff's suit was allowed to proceed.
* **Orders:** The court rejected the respondent's cross-objections.

## 7. Implications

* **Impact on Law:**
    * This judgment reinforces the principle that objections to territorial jurisdiction under Order VII Rule 10 of the CPC should be decided on a demurrer, accepting the plaintiff's averments as true.
    * The judgment clarifies that the requirement of pre-institution mediation under Section 12A of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 is not applicable to suits that contemplate urgent interim relief.
* **Future Relevance:** This judgment is likely to serve as a precedent in future cases dealing with similar issues of territorial jurisdiction and the applicability of pre-institution mediation in commercial disputes.
* **Broader Context:** The case highlights the importance of procedural fairness and the need for courts to balance the interests of both parties in commercial disputes, particularly in situations involving alleged infringement and the potential need for urgent relief.

## 8. Summary Points
