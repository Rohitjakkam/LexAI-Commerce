•	**Appellants’ Argument:**
    * The Commercial Court is the competent court to execute awards under Section 36 of the Arbitration Act based on the interpretation of Sections 10(3) and 15(2) of the Commercial Courts Act.
    * The Commercial Court wrongly relied on the judgment in Sundaram Finance, which was overruled by the State of West Bengal judgment on the application of Section 42 of the Arbitration Act.
    * The Commercial Court should have followed the Gujarat High Court judgment in M/s. OCI Corporation, which upheld the transfer of execution petitions to Commercial Courts.
•	**Respondents’ Argument:**
    * The Principal Civil Court (Court of District and Sessions Judge) is the competent court to execute awards based on the definition of "Court" under Section 2(1)(e) of the Arbitration Act and the Supreme Court judgment in State of Maharashtra vs. Atlanta Limited.
    * Section 15 of the Commercial Courts Act pertains to transfer of suits and applications pending in Civil Courts, not execution applications.
    * The Commercial Court incorrectly applied the law and should have transferred the execution application to the District Court.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

•	**Interpretation of Law:**
    * The court interpreted Sections 10(3) and 15(2) of the Commercial Courts Act as establishing the Commercial Court as the competent body for handling commercial disputes, including execution of arbitral awards.
    * The court rejected the narrow interpretation of "applications" under Section 15(2), which was adopted by the Chattisgarh High Court, emphasizing its wider scope to include execution applications.
•	**Application of Law:**
    * The court applied the legal principles laid out in State of West Bengal vs. Associated Contractors and the Gujarat High Court judgment in M/s. OCI Corporation to determine the jurisdiction of the Commercial Court.
    * The court reasoned that the Commercial Court, being the designated forum for commercial disputes, should handle execution applications arising from arbitral awards in such disputes.
