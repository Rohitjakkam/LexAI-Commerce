## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Plaintiff's Argument (U.P. State Road Transport Corporation):**
    * The District Judge lacked jurisdiction to transfer the case because the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, didn't apply retroactively to cases already pending before the District Judge. 
    * The petitioner asserted that the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, did not mandate the transfer of existing arbitration cases to the Commercial Courts.
* **Defendant’s Argument (Ram Murti Mishra):**
    * The Commercial Courts Act, 2015, was applicable to all cases pending before the District Judge, including the arbitration case, as it did not have any provision for retroactivity.
    * The respondent argued that the Act, 2015, was a procedural law and therefore had a retrospective effect.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

    * The Court found that the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, came into effect in 2015 and commercial courts were established after amendments effective from 03.05.2018.
    * Section 15(2) of the Act, 2015, mandates the transfer of cases related to commercial disputes of specified value to the Commercial Courts, except those where a final judgment was reserved prior to the establishment of the Commercial Courts.
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The Court interpreted Section 15(2) of the Act, 2015, to mean that all cases, including pending ones, should be transferred to the Commercial Court, unless the final judgment was reserved before the establishment of the court.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The Court determined that the petitioner had not argued that the final judgment in the arbitration case was reserved before the establishment of the Commercial Court. Therefore, the District Judge had the jurisdiction to transfer the case to the Commercial Court.
