## 2. Background and Context

* **Brief Overview:** Bhartia Infra Projects Limited (Bhartia) contracted with the State of Tripura (Tripura) to construct a permanent bridge over river Manu.

* **Key Issues:**
    * Whether the Arbitrator's decision on specific claims (extra work, loss of profit, and idle establishment) was patently illegal.
    * Whether the entire award should be set aside based on the alleged illegality of the Arbitrator's decisions.
    * Whether the case should be remanded to the Arbitrator for further adjudication on the entire dispute.

    * **Severability:** The ability to separate parts of an award that are independent of each other, allowing for partial setting aside.

## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Appellant's Argument (Bhartia):**
    * The learned Commercial Court erred in setting aside the entire award when the challenge was limited to specific claims.
    * Remanding the matter to the Arbitrator for fresh adjudication on the entire dispute was not justified.
    * The Arbitrator's decisions on extra work and loss of profit were not patently illegal and should have been upheld.
* **Respondent's Argument (Tripura):**
    * The Arbitrator's findings on extra work, loss of profit, and idle establishment were sound and supported by reasoning.
    * Remanding the matter to the Arbitrator was appropriate as the challenged claims were intertwined with the rest of the dispute.
    * Bhartia's argument about the inadmissibility of remanding the case was legally untenable.

## 5. Court's Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The Tripura High Court found that the Arbitrator's decisions on extra work and loss of profit did not suffer from patent illegality.
    * The Arbitrator's decision on idle establishment was found to be devoid of reason and, therefore, patently illegal.
    * The Court acknowledged the principle of minimalist intervention and the limited scope of interference under Section 34 of the Act of 1996.
    * The Court recognized that partial setting aside of an award is permissible under specific circumstances.
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The Court thoroughly analyzed the legal principles governing the scope of interference with arbitral awards, particularly under Section 34 of the Act of 1996.
    * The Court distinguished between "patent illegality" and "erroneous application of law," highlighting the narrow interpretation of the former.
    * The Court emphasized the limited powers of a court under Section 37, which is an appeal against a Section 34 order.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The Court applied the principles of "patent illegality" and "perversity" to evaluate the Arbitrator's findings on each claim.
    * The Court applied the principle of "severability" to determine whether the challenged claims could be separated from the rest of the award.
    * The Court considered the relevant precedents, particularly those dealing with the grounds for setting aside an award under Section 34 and the power to partially set aside an award.

## 6. Judgment

* **Final Decision:**
    * The Tripura High Court allowed the appeal partially.
    * The impugned order of the Commercial Court setting aside the entire award was set aside.
    * The matter was remitted to the Arbitrator to decide the claim for compensation for idle establishment afresh.
* **Relief Granted:**
    * The Arbitrator's findings on extra work and loss of profit were upheld.
    * The claim for idle establishment compensation was remanded for fresh adjudication.
* **Orders:**
    * The Arbitrator was directed to decide the claim under item No. 5 (idle establishment) within a reasonable period of 3 months from the date of receipt of the judgment.

## 7. Implications

* **Impact on Law:**
    * The judgment reiterates the principles governing judicial intervention in arbitral awards, emphasizing the limited scope for setting aside awards and the preference for minimalist intervention.
    * The judgment clarifies the application of the concept of "patent illegality" and its distinction from "erroneous application of law."
    * The judgment strengthens the principle of "severability," allowing for partial setting aside of awards where the challenged parts are distinct and independent.
* **Future Relevance:**
    * This case provides guidance to courts and parties on the appropriate approach to challenging arbitral awards under Section 34 and 37 of the Act of 1996.
    * The judgment could influence future decisions on the scope of judicial review in arbitration cases, particularly in cases involving partial setting aside of awards.
