## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Plaintiff's Argument:** 
    * The dispute falls under the definition of a "commercial dispute" in the Commercial Courts Act, specifically under Section 2(c)(vii) - agreements related to immovable property used exclusively in trade or commerce.
    * The land, despite not being currently used for trade or commerce, was intended for such use through the development of the Biotech Park.
    * The word "used" in the statute should not be interpreted as "actually used" but rather encompass future intended use. 
    * The Commercial Court has jurisdiction to hear the case.
* **Defendant's Argument:**
    * The dispute does not qualify as a "commercial dispute" because the land was not actually used for trade or commerce at the time of the dispute.
    * The phrase "immovable property used exclusively in trade or commerce" in Section 2(c)(vii) requires actual or present use, not potential future use. 
    * The Commercial Court lacked jurisdiction to hear the case.
    * Citing precedents, the defendant argued for a strict and literal interpretation of the statutory provisions.

## 5. Courtâ€™s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The Court emphasized the importance of interpreting statutory provisions literally and strictly, without adding words or interpretations not present in the statute.
    * The Court concluded that the agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant did not constitute an agreement relating to "immovable property used exclusively in trade or commerce" as per Section 2(c)(vii) of the Commercial Courts Act.
    * The Court highlighted that the land in question was not actually used for trade or commerce at the time of the suit, even though it was intended for such use in the future.
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The Court interpreted the word "used" in Section 2(c)(vii) of the Commercial Courts Act to mean "actually used" or "being used" and not "ready for use" or "likely to be used" in the future.
    * The Court relied on the precedent of Dineshkumar Gulabchand Agrawal (Supra), where the Bombay High Court concluded that "used" denotes "actually used" and not merely "ready for use."
* **Application of Law:**
    * Applying the literal interpretation of the statute and the precedents cited, the Court concluded that the dispute did not qualify as a "commercial dispute" under Section 2(c) of the Commercial Courts Act. 
    * The Court held that the Commercial Court lacked jurisdiction to hear the case, as the dispute did not fall within the definition of "commercial dispute." 

## 6. Judgment

    * The impugned order of the Commercial Court returning the plaint was upheld.

## 7. Implications
