## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Plaintiff's Argument (ONGC):**
    * ASPL's barge (M.V.PREETISAGAR) collided with ONGC's diffuser system due to ASPL's negligence.
    * The collision was not an "Act of God," as ASPL's crew members could have prevented it by taking necessary precautions.
    * The trial court erred in dismissing the suit on the "Act of God" ground without specifically framing an issue regarding it.
    * ONGC cited several Supreme Court decisions to support their claim.
* **Defendant's Argument (ASPL & Oriental):**
    * The collision was a result of the "Act of God" - a strong current in the Tapi River that broke mooring ropes and caused the barges to drift uncontrollably.
    * ASPL's crew members acted diligently to avoid the collision.
    * The trial court correctly dismissed the suit based on the evidence proving the "Act of God" as the primary cause.
    * The defendants relied on Supreme Court precedents to argue that the failure to frame a specific issue regarding "Act of God" didn't vitiate the proceedings.

## 5. Court's Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The court found that the plaintiff (ONGC) failed to prove that the collision was caused by ASPL's negligence.
    * The court held that the collision occurred due to the strong current in the Tapi River, which was an "Act of God," and therefore, the defendants (ASPL & Oriental) were not liable.
    * The court concluded that the trial court's failure to specifically frame an issue regarding "Act of God" did not prejudice the proceedings as both parties presented evidence and arguments on this issue.
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The court interpreted the "Act of God" doctrine as a natural event beyond human control, absolving the defendant from liability.
    * The court applied the principle that the plaintiff bears the burden of proving their case, including the defendant's negligence.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The court applied the "Act of God" doctrine to the facts of the case, finding that the strong current in the river was a natural event beyond human control and caused the collision.
    * The court applied the burden of proof principle, finding that ONGC failed to prove ASPL's negligence.
