* **Legal Doctrines:**
    * Public Policy: The court examined whether the Arbitrator's award violated the fundamental policy of Indian law, particularly in relation to contract law and the principles of natural justice.
    * Patent Illegality: The court assessed if the award was patently illegal, meaning if it went to the root of the matter and was not merely a trivial error in the application of the law.
    * Perversity: The court scrutinized if the Arbitrator's decision was perverse, meaning if it was based on no evidence or ignored vital evidence.
    * Estoppel: The court considered the principle of estoppel, which prevents a party from taking advantage of their own wrong.

## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Plaintiff’s Argument (State of Jharkhand):** 
    * The Respondent failed to comply with the MSA by not establishing all 600 CSCs.
    * The Respondent was not entitled to revenue support because they did not fulfill the condition of 100% operational CSCs as stipulated in the agreement.
    * The State suffered significant losses due to the Respondent's non-performance.
    * The Arbitrator erred in awarding the Respondent revenue support and failed to consider the State's counterclaim for damages adequately.
* **Defendant’s Argument (M/S Alternative For India Development):**
    * The Respondent established 99% of the CSCs (594 out of 600), which was substantial performance.
    * The State was responsible for issuing the operational certificate, which they failed to do due to a faulty software system.
    * The Respondent was not liable for any penalty because the penalty clause was deleted from the MSA by a subsequent agreement.
    * The Arbitrator's award was justified as it considered the circumstances and the State's failure to provide the operational certificate.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The court emphasized the importance of adhering to contractual obligations and the principle of estoppel.
    * The court noted that the State failed to provide the operational certificate due to technical glitches, which could be considered a breach of their own obligations under the agreement.
    * The court found that the Arbitrator considered all relevant factors, including the substantial performance by the Respondent, the State's failure to provide the operational certificate, and the State's counterclaim for damages.
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The court cited various precedents, particularly those related to the scope of judicial review in arbitral awards and the application of public policy principles.
    * The court emphasized that judicial intervention in arbitral awards should be limited to cases of patent illegality, perversity, or violation of public policy.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The court determined that the Arbitrator's decision did not violate public policy or fall into the category of patent illegality or perversity.
    * The court ruled that the State, by failing to provide the operational certificate, contributed to the situation and could not use their own breach to deny the Respondent revenue support.

## 6. Judgment

* **Final Decision:** The appeal filed by the State of Jharkhand was dismissed.
* **Relief Granted:** The court upheld the Arbitrator's award, which awarded revenue support to the Respondent and awarded a lesser amount to the State for their counterclaim.
* **Orders:** The court ordered the parties to comply with the Arbitrator's award and dismissed all pending interlocutory applications.

## 7. Implications

* **Impact on Law:** This judgment reinforces the principles of limited judicial review of arbitral awards and the importance of adhering to contractual obligations.
* **Future Relevance:** The case provides guidance on how courts should approach disputes arising from contracts involving substantial performance and the role of estoppel.
* **Broader Context:** The case highlights the need for clear contractual terms and a mechanism for resolving disputes fairly when parties fail to fully comply with their obligations.
