## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Appellant’s Argument:**
    * The Appellant argued that the actual delay in filing the appeal was only 21 days, not 51 days, as they received the arbitral award on 19.09.2018.
    * They emphasized that the delay occurred due to the complexity of the case, the need to consult with a Chartered Accountant, and the necessity to obtain legal advice before filing the appeal.
    * The Appellant cited various case laws to argue for a liberal interpretation of the condonation of delay provisions and to emphasize the importance of reaching a fair resolution.
    * The Appellant contended that Section 34(3) of the Act was meant to ensure prompt resolution of disputes and that strict adherence to the time limit should not be prioritized over achieving justice.
* **Respondent’s Argument:**
    * The Respondent argued that the 3-month limitation period for challenging arbitral awards, as laid out in Section 34(3) of the Act, was mandatory.
    * They pointed out that the "but not thereafter" clause in the proviso to Section 34(3) explicitly excluded the applicability of Section 5 of the Limitation Act, which allows for condonation of delay in certain circumstances.
    * The Respondent relied on previous Supreme Court judgments, including the Popular Construction Company case, to support their claim that the Court cannot condone delay beyond the 30-day extension after the initial 3-month period.
    * The Respondent emphasized that allowing the Appellant to challenge the award after the prescribed period would undermine the Act's objective of reducing judicial intervention in arbitration.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The Court acknowledged the Appellant's argument regarding the actual delay, but it considered the 51-day delay, as stated in the application, to be sufficient for its analysis.
    * The Court meticulously analyzed the relevant legal provisions, specifically focusing on the "but not thereafter" clause in the proviso to Section 34(3) of the Act.
* **Interpretation of Law:** The Court concluded that the "but not thereafter" clause expressly barred the application of Section 5 of the Limitation Act, which deals with condonation of delay. The Court held that this clause had been consistently interpreted by the Supreme Court as a clear exclusion of any further extension beyond the initial 30-day period after the 3-month limitation.
* **Application of Law:**  Based on the established legal interpretation and the fact that the Appellant filed the application for condonation of delay beyond the 3-month + 30-day period, the Court found no grounds to condone the delay.

## 6. Judgment

* **Final Decision:** The Gujarat High Court upheld the Commercial Court's decision to dismiss the Appellant's application for condonation of delay. The appeal was dismissed.
