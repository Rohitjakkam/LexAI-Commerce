## 2. Background and Context

**Brief Overview:** This case revolves around disputes arising from agreements between the Director ESD (Mee Seva) and several software companies, including CCS Infotech Limited and United Telecoms Limited, to operate e-governance service centers in Hyderabad and Secunderabad.

3. Whether the Arbitrator's findings and conclusions on the revision of rates and transaction slabs were legally valid.

## 4. Arguments Presented

**Plaintiff's Argument (Mee Seva):**
* The Arbitrator exceeded his jurisdiction by passing both a preliminary and final award.
* The Arbitrator's conclusions regarding the rate revision were erroneous as the government order was prospective, not retrospective.
* The Commercial Court erred in modifying the Arbitrator's award as it was not authorized to do so under Section 34.
* The Arbitrator's decision to split the award into two separate awards is illegal.

**Defendant's Argument (CCS Infotech Ltd., United Telecoms Ltd., and others):**
* The Arbitrator was within his powers to pass both a preliminary and final award.
* The Commercial Court's modification of the interest rate was unjustified.
* The Arbitrator's findings on the revision of rates were correct.
* The Arbitrator's decision to pass two separate awards does not affect the validity of the awards.

## 5. Court's Analysis and Reasoning

**Key Findings:**
* The Arbitrator's decision to split the award into a preliminary and final award was illegal and outside the scope of the Arbitration Act.
* The Commercial Court lacked the authority to modify the Arbitrator's award under Section 34.
* The Arbitrator's decision to continue the contract beyond its original term via interim orders was an excess of jurisdiction.

**Interpretation of Law:**
* The court interpreted Section 34 of the Arbitration Act, 1996, to confirm that the Court's role is limited to setting aside an award, not modifying it.
* The court analyzed Section 32 and 33 of the Act to conclude that the Arbitrator cannot pass multiple awards and can only correct clerical errors or interpret specific parts of the award.

**Application of Law:**
* The court applied the principle of functus officio to find that the Arbitrator exceeded his jurisdiction by passing the final award after the preliminary award was challenged under Section 34.
* The court relied on precedent to reaffirm that the Commercial Court's modification of the Arbitrator's award was not permissible under Section 34.

## 6. Judgment

**Final Decision:**
* The Telangana High Court allowed the appeals filed by the software companies and the Mee Seva organizations.
* The court declared the Arbitrator's awards and the Commercial Court's decision in the Section 34 application as vitiated.

**Relief Granted:**
* The court remitted the matter back to arbitration proceedings, appointing a new Arbitrator, Justice Vilas V. Afzulpurkar, to re-examine the case.

**Orders:**
* The parties were ordered to submit all relevant documents to the new Arbitrator within four weeks.
* The new Arbitrator was requested to conclude the proceedings expeditiously, ideally within 16 weeks.

## 7. Implications

**Impact on Law:**
