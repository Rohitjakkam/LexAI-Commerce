    * **Deemed stay:**  Under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, filing an application to set aside an award creates a deemed stay on the award's execution.
    * **Patent illegality:**  An error of law that is so fundamental and apparent that it renders the award invalid.

## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Appellant’s Argument (CCS Infotech Limited, United Telecoms Limited, and CMS Computers Limited):**
    * The Commercial Court erred in modifying the Arbitrator's award, as it only has the power to set aside or remand the award, not alter it.
    * The Commercial Court's interpretation of the Government Order regarding electricity bills as being prospective, not retrospective, was incorrect.
    * The reduction of interest rates from 12% to 6% was unjustified.
    * The Arbitrator's award was correct and should be accepted in its entirety.
* **Respondent’s Argument (Mee Seva):**
    * The Arbitrator's decision to pass two separate awards (preliminary and final) was illegal, as he became functus officio after the preliminary award. 
    * The Arbitrator exceeded his jurisdiction by extending the contract beyond the agreed-upon duration through interim orders.
    * The Arbitrator's conclusions regarding electricity bills were perverse and contradicted earlier findings in the award.
    * The Commercial Court should have remanded the case to the Arbitrator for a fresh award instead of modifying it. 

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The Court found that the Arbitrator's decision to split the award into a preliminary and final award was illegal, contradicting the scheme of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.
    * The Court held that the Commercial Court lacked the jurisdiction to modify the Arbitrator's award under Section 34 of the Act.
    * The Court acknowledged the precedent set by the Supreme Court, stating that Section 34 only permits setting aside or remanding of awards, not modification.
    * The Court determined that the final award passed by the Arbitrator was nonest in the eye of law due to the pending application under Section 34 challenging the preliminary award.
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The Court strictly interpreted Section 34 of the Act, emphasizing the limited scope of judicial intervention in arbitration matters. 
    * The Court relied on previous Supreme Court decisions that clarified the Court's role in Section 34 applications.
    * The Court interpreted the 'deemed stay' provision in Section 34 to be applicable to the entire award, not just parts of it.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The Court applied the principle of functus officio to the Arbitrator's actions, deeming the final award void due to the earlier preliminary award and the pending challenge under Section 34. 
    * The Court applied the limitations imposed by Section 34 to restrict the Commercial Court's power to modifying the award.

## 6. Judgment

* **Final Decision:** The appeals filed by both the claimants (software companies) and Mee Seva were allowed. 
* **Relief Granted:** The Court remanded the entire matter back to the Arbitral Tribunal.
* **Orders:**
    * A new Arbitrator, Sri Justice Vilas V.Afzulpurkar, was appointed.
    * The parties were instructed to submit all relevant documents to the new Arbitrator within four weeks.
    * The new Arbitrator was requested to conclude the arbitration proceedings expeditiously, preferably within 16 weeks.

## 7. Implications

* **Impact on Law:** 
    * This case reinforces the limited scope of judicial intervention in arbitration proceedings as defined by Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.
    * The decision further clarifies that courts cannot modify arbitral awards under Section 34 and are limited to setting aside or remanding them.
* **Future Relevance:** 
    * This case serves as a precedent for future disputes involving arbitration awards challenged under Section 34, clarifying the limited powers of courts in such cases.
    * It also highlights the importance of carefully following the legal framework of arbitration proceedings to avoid procedural errors and ensure the validity of awards.
* **Broader Context:** 
    * This case highlights the delicate balance between respecting party autonomy in arbitration and ensuring the fairness and legal validity of arbitral proceedings.
