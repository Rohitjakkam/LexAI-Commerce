## 2. Background and Context

**Brief Overview:** Two separate suits were filed before the Bombay High Court. The first suit (Suit No. 516 of 2013) was filed by Manugraph India Limited against Sigmarq Technologies Pvt. Ltd. and its directors, while the second suit (Suit No. 632 of 2014) was filed by Ezeego One Travel & Tours Ltd. against Le Travenues Technology Pvt. Ltd. Both suits involved commercial disputes. The defendants in both suits argued that the Bombay High Court lacked jurisdiction to hear the cases, as the cause of action arose in Delhi (for Suit No. 632) and Kolhapur (for Suit No. 516) where the plaintiffs had branch offices.

**Key Issues:** The main issue in both cases was whether the Bombay High Court had territorial jurisdiction to hear the suits, given the plaintiffs' branch offices in other locations where the defendants argued the cause of action arose.

## 4. Arguments Presented

**Plaintiff’s Argument:** The plaintiffs argued that the Bombay High Court had jurisdiction to hear the suits, as they had their registered offices in Mumbai and the suits involved commercial disputes of specified value as defined under the Commercial Courts Act. They emphasized the importance of the Bombay High Court being able to adjudicate such matters efficiently and expeditiously, considering the purpose behind the Act.

**Defendant’s Argument:** The defendants in both cases argued that the Bombay High Court lacked jurisdiction to hear the suits, as the cause of action arose in Delhi (for Suit No. 632) and Kolhapur (for Suit No. 516), where the plaintiffs had branch offices. They asserted that the territorial jurisdiction of a court is determined by the location where the cause of action arises, and not the registered office of the plaintiff. They also argued that the Bombay High Court's decision on the preliminary issue of jurisdiction was a final determination of their rights, making it appealable under the Commercial Courts Act.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

**Key Findings:**

* **The court found that the order passed by the learned single Judge on the preliminary issue of jurisdiction was not a "final determination" of the rights of the parties.** The court reasoned that even if the Bombay High Court found that it had jurisdiction, the suit could still be dismissed on merits. If the suit were decreed, the defendants would still be able to challenge the decree on appeal, including the issue of jurisdiction.
* **The court acknowledged that the defendants were "aggrieved" by the decision, but this alone did not make the order appealable.** 
* **The court emphasized the object and purpose of the Commercial Courts Act, which was to ensure the expeditious disposal of commercial disputes.**  Allowing an appeal against a ruling on a preliminary issue of jurisdiction would delay the proceedings and defeat the purpose of the Act.

**Interpretation of Law:**

* The court referred to various precedents, particularly the Supreme Court decision in Shah Babulal Khimji vs Jayaben D. Kania & Anr., AIR 1981 SC 1786, to determine the meaning of "judgment" in the context of appealable orders. 
* The court analyzed the definitions of "decree" and "order" in the CPC. 
* The court carefully reviewed the language of Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, focusing on the distinction between appeals against "decisions" and those against "orders."
* The court considered the applicability of the non-obstante clause in Section 13(2) of the Commercial Courts Act, which overrides other laws regarding appeals.

**Application of Law:**

* The court concluded that the order under appeal did not satisfy the tests for being considered a "judgment" as per the precedents and legal definitions. 
* The court applied the principle of judicial discipline by recognizing the need to maintain consistency in legal rulings, particularly regarding the scope of appeals under the Commercial Courts Act.
* The court weighed the potential impact of allowing an appeal on the expeditious disposal of commercial disputes, a key objective of the Commercial Courts Act.

## 6. Judgment

**Final Decision:** The court upheld the preliminary objection raised by the plaintiff, finding that the order challenged in the appeal was not an appealable order under the Commercial Courts Act. The court dismissed the appeals.

**Relief Granted:** No specific relief was granted, as the appeals were dismissed.

**Orders:** The court refused the request of the defendants to postpone the hearing of the Notice of Motion seeking interim relief. 

## 7. Implications

**Impact on Law:** This judgment clarifies the scope of appealable orders under the Commercial Courts Act, particularly in relation to preliminary rulings on jurisdiction. The court's interpretation emphasizes the importance of the Act's objective to ensure efficient and expeditious disposal of commercial disputes.

**Future Relevance:** This case provides guidance for future decisions on the maintainability of appeals under the Commercial Courts Act. It highlights the need for a cautious approach to determining whether an order is a "judgment" within the meaning of the Act, particularly in light of the statutory mandate to ensure swift resolution of commercial disputes.

**Broader Context:** This decision reflects the broader trend of emphasizing efficiency and streamlining procedures in commercial courts to resolve disputes quickly and effectively. 

## 8. Summary Points

* The court applied the legal definition of "judgment" as per precedents and concluded that the impugned order did not meet the necessary criteria.
