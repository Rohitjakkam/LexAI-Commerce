## Arguments Presented

* **Petitioner’s Argument:**
    * The Commercial Court exceeded its jurisdiction by not granting injunction relief, particularly considering the petitioner's plea that the termination notice was about to expire.
    * The Commercial Court failed to uphold the provisions of Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, rendering them ineffective.
    * The High Court should intervene under Article 227 to rectify the jurisdictional error committed by the Commercial Court.
    * The petitioner argued that the court's decision was flawed because it did not grant the necessary injunction relief despite the impending expiry of the termination notice.
    * The petitioner emphasized that the matter would become infructuous if the termination notice was allowed to expire without a stay order.
* **Respondent’s Argument:**
    * The High Court lacks jurisdiction to entertain this petition because Section 37(1)(b) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act provides for an appeal against the order passed by the Commercial Court.
    * The petitioner should have exercised the available remedy of appeal instead of directly approaching the High Court.
    * The petitioner's claim of "jurisdictional error" is unfounded, and the High Court should not interfere in matters where a specific appellate remedy exists.
    * The respondent argued that the petitioner should have utilized the specific appeal route provided in the Arbitration and Conciliation Act.
    * The respondent stressed that the High Court should only intervene in exceptional circumstances, not in cases where a regular appeal process is available.

## Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The High Court acknowledged the importance of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act's objective to expedite commercial dispute resolution.
    * The Court held that the High Court's power under Article 227 should be exercised cautiously, particularly when specific appeal provisions exist within the relevant statutes.
    * The Court recognized the existence of a clear appeal mechanism under Section 37(1)(b) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act and Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act.
    * The Court emphasized that the "jurisdictional error" argument raised by the petitioner was not persuasive, given the established appeal provisions.
    * The Court highlighted that the grant of temporary relief, such as injunction, depends on factual considerations and is subject to the "trinity test" (prima facie case, balance of convenience, irreparable hardship), which can be adequately addressed through the appeal process.
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The Court interpreted the non obstante clause in Section 5 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, which limits judicial intervention except as provided in the Act.
    * The Court interpreted the specific appeal provisions in Section 37(1)(b) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act and Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act as creating a clear and specific remedy for the petitioner.
    * The Court interpreted the Supreme Court's judgment in Deep Industries Limited (supra) as advocating for limited intervention by the High Court under Article 227 when specific appeal provisions exist.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The Court applied the principle of exhaustion of remedies, requiring the petitioner to exhaust available statutory remedies before approaching the High Court under Article 227.
    * The Court applied the principles of statutory interpretation to determine the scope and limitations of the High Court's jurisdiction under Article 227.
    * The Court applied the principles of injunction relief, concluding that the petitioner could adequately address their concerns through the appeal process where the "trinity test" for injunction relief could be thoroughly assessed.

## Judgment

* **Final Decision:** The High Court dismissed the petitioner's application under Article 227 of the Constitution of India.
* **Relief Granted:** No relief was granted to the petitioner.
* **Orders:** The High Court directed the petitioner to avail their remedies of appeal, if so advised, in accordance with the applicable law.

## Implications

* **Impact on Law:** This judgment reinforces the principle that the High Court's extraordinary jurisdiction under Article 227 should be exercised cautiously, particularly when a specific appeal mechanism exists within the relevant statutory framework.
* **Future Relevance:** This case establishes a precedent for situations where the High Court should refrain from exercising jurisdiction under Article 227 when a statutory appeal remedy is available for the same issue. 
* **Broader Context:** The judgment emphasizes the importance of adhering to the statutory scheme for resolving commercial disputes, particularly in the context of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act and the Commercial Courts Act, which aim to expedite dispute resolution through specific provisions and procedures.

## Summary Points

* The High Court emphasized the importance of exhausting statutory remedies before seeking recourse to Article 227.
* The Court clarified that the principle of "jurisdictional error" is not sufficient to justify intervention under Article 227 when specific statutory appeal provisions exist.
