## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Petitioner’s Argument:**
    * The Municipal Corporation argued that M/s Accord Hydroair Pvt. Ltd. should be impleaded as a party in the arbitration case because it was effectively operating under the Tripartite Agreement despite not being an original signatory.
    * They claimed the additional evidence (arbitration awards) was relevant to the case and could not have been produced earlier due to lack of knowledge.
    * They cited the Supreme Court's judgment in Chloro Controls (I) P. Ltd. as precedent to support their argument for impleadment. 
* **Respondent’s Argument:**
    * Respondent no. 1 and 2 argued that M/s Accord Hydroair Pvt. Ltd. was not a party to the Tripartite Agreement and therefore could not be impleaded.
    * They claimed that the additional evidence was not admissible as it pertained to separate arbitration proceedings involving parties not directly involved in the current case.
    * They argued that the Chloro Controls (I) P. Ltd. judgment was not applicable to the present case as it involved different statutory provisions and facts.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The Court recognized that M/s Accord Hydroair Pvt. Ltd. was not a signatory to the Tripartite Agreement and therefore could not be impleaded in the current arbitration case. 
    * The Court found that the Chloro Controls (I) P. Ltd. case was distinguishable and did not support the petitioner's argument for impleadment. 
    * The Court acknowledged the principle of privity of contract, whereby a contract only binds the parties who signed it.
    * The Court held that the additional evidence (arbitration awards) was admissible because the petitioner could not have produced them earlier due to lack of knowledge, even though they were not a party to the previous proceedings. 
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The Court interpreted Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act to emphasize that parties seeking to set aside an arbitration award must demonstrate that the award is invalid based on the record of the arbitral tribunal. 
    * The Court interpreted Order XLI Rule 27 of the Code of Civil Procedure in a manner that allowed the petitioner to submit additional evidence, particularly under sub-rule (aa), which allows for evidence not previously known.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The Court applied the principle of privity of contract to reject the petitioner's request for impleadment of M/s Accord Hydroair Pvt. Ltd. 
    * The Court applied Order XLI Rule 27 of the Code of Civil Procedure to allow the petitioner to submit the arbitration awards as additional evidence, acknowledging the petitioner's lack of previous knowledge of the awards.

## 6. Judgment

* **Final Decision:**
    * The petition was partly allowed. The Court quashed the order rejecting the petitioner's application for adducing additional evidence in the form of copies of the arbitration awards.
* **Relief Granted:**
    * The Court granted the petitioner permission to submit the five arbitration awards as additional evidence. 
* **Orders:**
    * The Commercial Court was ordered to proceed with the application under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, taking into consideration the additional evidence and allowing the respondents to rebut it.

## 7. Implications

* **Impact on Law:**
    * The judgment reinforces the importance of privity of contract in arbitration proceedings, highlighting that only parties to the agreement can be bound by its terms. 
    * The judgment provides a nuanced interpretation of Order XLI Rule 27, emphasizing the allowance of additional evidence when a party establishes that the evidence was not previously known despite due diligence.
* **Future Relevance:**
    * This judgment may serve as precedent for future cases involving impleadment in arbitration proceedings, particularly when non-signatory parties are involved. 
    * It also sets a precedent for the application of Order XLI Rule 27 in Commercial Courts, allowing for the admission of additional evidence in specific circumstances.
* **Broader Context:**
    * The case highlights the complexities of arbitration proceedings, especially when multiple agreements and parties are involved. 
    * It underscores the importance of careful contract drafting to prevent disputes and ensure clarity on the scope of contractual obligations.
