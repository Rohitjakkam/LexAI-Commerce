## 4. Arguments Presented

•	**Plaintiff’s Argument**:
    * In cases involving commercial disputes, Section 12A of the CCA, 2015 should be considered directory, not mandatory.
    * Failure to comply with Section 12A shouldn't be fatal to a suit, especially when pre-institution mediation wasn't feasible or infrastructure was absent.
    * The court should exercise its jurisdiction under Section 15 of the CCA, 2015 to transfer suits to the Commercial Division, even if they were initially filed in the Ordinary Original Civil Jurisdiction.
    * The court should interpret Section 15 broadly, enabling the transfer of suits even after the notification of the Specified Value.

•	**Defendant’s Argument**:
    * Section 12A of the CCA, 2015 is mandatory, and failure to comply with its requirements should lead to the dismissal of the suit.
    * Suits filed after the notification of the Specified Value cannot be transferred to the Commercial Division under Section 15(1), as they are not "pending" within the meaning of the provision.
    * The court should strictly construe the provisions of the CCA, 2015, ensuring compliance with pre-institution mediation and transfer procedures.

•	**Key Findings**:
    * The court found that Section 12A of the CCA, 2015 is mandatory, considering its objective of expediting commercial dispute resolution through pre-institution mediation.
