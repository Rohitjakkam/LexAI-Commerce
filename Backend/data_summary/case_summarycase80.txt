## Background and Context

(Defendants) seeking a permanent injunction to restrain the Defendants from infringing the Plaintiff's registered trademark "LETROZ".

• **Key Issues**: 
    * Whether the present suit was maintainable despite the pendency of the first suit.
    * Whether the delay in adjudicating the interim injunction application in the first suit constituted a fresh cause of action for the Plaintiff.

## Arguments Presented

• **Plaintiff's Argument**: 
    * The delay in adjudicating the interim injunction application in the first suit, which was filed in 2017, constituted a fresh cause of action for each sale of the infringing product by the Defendants. This argument was based on the **Bengal Waterproof** judgment.
    * Every sale of the infringing product by the Defendants constituted a new and independent cause of action for the Plaintiff.
    * The Plaintiff intended to withdraw the first suit. 
    * The Plaintiff was seeking different relief in the second suit (damages) compared to the first suit (rendition of accounts), which justified filing a separate suit.

• **Defendant's Argument**:
    * The cause of action in both suits was identical and related to the same period.
    * Filing the second suit was a gross abuse of the process of the court and amounted to forum shopping.
    * The Plaintiff could not seek both damages and rendition of accounts in separate suits for the same infringement under the Trademarks Act, 1999.
    * The delay in the first suit did not constitute a fresh cause of action, and the principle of **res sub judice** barred the filing of the second suit. 

## Court's Analysis and Reasoning

• **Key Findings**:
    * The parties, the trademarks, the rights being asserted, and the cause of action in both suits were identical.
    * The only difference between the two suits was the relief sought – one sought rendition of accounts while the other sought damages. However, the Court found this difference to be irrelevant as Section 135(1) of the Trademarks Act, 1999, allowed the Plaintiff to choose only one relief (damages or rendition of accounts) for the same infringement. 
    * The Plaintiff had explicitly stated in the second suit that they intended to withdraw the first suit. 
    * The delay in adjudicating the interim injunction application in the first suit did not justify the filing of a separate suit.

• **Interpretation of Law**:
    * The Court carefully analyzed the **Bengal Waterproof** judgment and found it distinguishable from the present case. The **Bengal Waterproof** case involved the dismissal of the first suit for technical reasons, while in the present case, the first suit was pending and the Court was seized of the matter.
    * The Court also discussed the principle of **res sub judice**, concluding that the Plaintiff's second suit was barred. 
    * The Court emphasized the application of Section 135(1) of the Trademarks Act, 1999, which prohibited seeking both damages and rendition of accounts for the same infringement in separate suits. 
    * The Court condemned the practice of forum shopping and considered it an abuse of the process of the court. 
    * The Court stressed the importance of timely pronouncements of judgments by trial courts.

• **Application of Law**:
    * The Court applied the principles of **res sub judice**, forum shopping, and the provisions of the Trademarks Act, 1999, to the facts of the case.
    * The Court held that the delay in adjudicating the interim injunction application in the first suit did not constitute a fresh cause of action.
    * The Court dismissed the Plaintiff's argument that seeking different reliefs in the two suits justified filing separate suits. 

## Judgment

• **Final Decision**: The Court dismissed the Plaintiff's suit as not maintainable.

• **Relief Granted**: No relief was granted to the Plaintiff.

• **Orders**: 
    * The Court directed the Registrar General to send a copy of the judgment to the Inspecting Committee of the concerned Judicial Officer of the Commercial Court, who had delayed the pronouncement of the order on the interim injunction application in the first suit.
    * The Court also directed the Registrar General to circulate this judgment to all judicial officers in the Trial Court.

## Implications

• **Impact on Law**: This judgment reinforces the principle of **res sub judice** and reaffirms the importance of preventing forum shopping. It also clarifies that a Plaintiff cannot circumvent the provisions of Section 135(1) of the Trademarks Act, 1999, by seeking different reliefs in separate suits. 

• **Future Relevance**: This case sets a precedent for future trademark infringement cases, particularly when there is a pending suit between the same parties on the same cause of action. It provides a clear framework for courts to consider when evaluating the maintainability of subsequent suits.

• **Broader Context**: The case highlights the need for courts to be vigilant in preventing abuse of the judicial process by litigants seeking to manipulate the system for strategic advantage. It also emphasizes the importance of judicial efficiency and timely pronouncement of judgments by trial courts. 

## Summary Points

* **Main Issue**: The maintainability of a second suit for trademark infringement while a similar suit is pending in another court.
* **Key Finding**:  The Plaintiff's second suit was not maintainable because it was based on the same cause of action as the first suit. 
* **Decision**: The Plaintiff's suit was dismissed.
* **Legal Implications**:  Reinforces the principles of *res sub judice* and the prohibition against forum shopping. 
* **Importance**: Demonstrates the courts' commitment to preventing the abuse of judicial processes and ensuring efficient legal proceedings.
