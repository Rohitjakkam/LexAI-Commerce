## Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The court found that the impugned order was not appealable under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, as the order closing the opportunity to file a written statement was not specifically enumerated in Order 43 of the CPC.
    * The court relied on the Supreme Court's judgment in S.C.G. Contracts (India) Private Limited (Supra), which held that the right to file a written statement stands forfeited after the prescribed time period and any extension allowed under the law.
    * The court clarified that the Supreme Court's order in the Suo-moto Writ (Civil) No. 03 of 2020 only extended the limitation period and did not condone delays.
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The court interpreted the relevant provisions of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, and the CPC, emphasizing the mandatory nature of the time limits for filing a written statement.
    * The court also carefully considered the scope of the Supreme Court's order in the Suo-moto Writ (Civil) No. 03 of 2020.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The court applied the legal principles to the facts of the case, concluding that the petitioner had not filed the written statement within the prescribed time and that the lockdown period did not justify an extension.

## Judgment

* **Final Decision:** The petition was dismissed.
* **Relief Granted:** No relief was granted to the petitioner.
* **Orders:** The court affirmed the order of the Commercial Court closing the opportunity to file a written statement.
