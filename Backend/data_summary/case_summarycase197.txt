## 1. Case Title

* **Case Name:** Ajmer Vidyut Vitaran Nigam Limited (AVVNL) vs. Hindustan Zinc Limited (HZL)
* **Court:** Rajasthan High Court
* **Date of Judgment:** April 5, 2018
* **Citation:** D.B. Civil Miscellaneous Appeal No.2803/2017

## 2. Background and Context

* **Brief Overview:** This case concerns a dispute between AVVNL, an electricity distribution company, and HZL, an industrial company operating a captive power plant (CPP) in Rajasthan. HZL entered into agreements with AVVNL for open access to AVVNL's distribution system to wheel power from its CPP to its other industrial units. The dispute arose when AVVNL billed HZL for unscheduled interchange (UI) charges, which are levied when there is a mismatch between scheduled and actual drawl of power. HZL challenged these charges before the Rajasthan Electricity Regulatory Commission (RERC) and eventually obtained an arbitration award in its favor. AVVNL then filed objections against the award in the Commercial Court, which were dismissed. This appeal challenges the Commercial Court's judgment upholding the arbitration award.
* **Key Issues:**
    * Whether the dispute regarding UI charges was arbitrable under the provisions of the Electricity Act, 2003, and the Rajasthan Electricity Regulatory Commission (Terms and Conditions for Open Access) Regulations, 2004 (Regulations of 2004).
    * Whether the arbitrator exceeded his jurisdiction by addressing issues beyond the scope of the reference made by the RERC.
    * Whether the arbitrator was justified in holding certain clauses of the open access agreements as being contrary to the Regulations of 2004 and the Electricity Act, 2003.

    * **Perversity:** The court assessed whether the arbitrator's findings were perverse and unsupported by the evidence or legal principles.

## 4. Arguments Presented

* **AVVNL's Argument:**
    * The dispute regarding UI charges was not arbitrable because the Regulations of 2004 established an exclusive redressal mechanism under clause 29 for open access disputes.
    * The arbitrator exceeded his jurisdiction by addressing issues beyond the scope of the reference, which was limited to the billing of UI charges.
    * The arbitrator's findings that certain clauses of the open access agreements were unlawful were perverse and contrary to the Regulations of 2004, the Act of 2003, and the Commission's previous orders.
    * HZL was estopped from challenging the validity of the agreements after receiving benefits under them.
* **HZL's Argument:**
    * The dispute was arbitrable because the Act of 2003 empowers the Commission to refer disputes between a licensee and a generating company to arbitration.
    * The reference to the arbitrator was open-ended and permitted him to address all issues related to AVVNL's arbitrary billing of UI charges.
    * The arbitrator was justified in holding certain clauses of the open access agreements as being contrary to the Act of 2003 and the Commission's orders.
    * The arbitrator's findings were supported by the evidence and the law.

## 5. Court's Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The court found that the dispute regarding UI charges was not arbitrable because the Regulations of 2004 established an exclusive redressal mechanism under clause 29, precluding arbitration.
    * The court held that the arbitrator exceeded his jurisdiction by addressing issues beyond the scope of the reference, which was limited to the billing of UI charges.
    * The court concluded that the arbitrator's findings regarding the invalidity of certain clauses in the open access agreements were perverse and unsupported by the evidence or legal principles.
    * The court upheld the principle of estoppel, stating that HZL was estopped from challenging the validity of the agreements after receiving benefits under them.
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The court interpreted the Regulations of 2004 as establishing an exclusive redressal mechanism for open access disputes, which barred arbitration.
    * The court interpreted the Act of 2003 as not overriding the specific provisions of the Regulations of 2004 regarding dispute resolution.
    * The court interpreted the scope of the arbitrator's reference as being limited to the billing of UI charges, not the validity of the open access agreements.
    * The court relied on case law to support the principle of estoppel and the doctrine of severability.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The court applied the principles of arbitrability and waiver to determine that the dispute was not arbitrable and that HZL had not waived its right to object to the arbitrator's jurisdiction.
    * The court applied the principle of severability to uphold the agreements' remaining clauses while holding certain clauses invalid.
    * The court applied the principle of estoppel to prevent HZL from challenging the agreements' validity after receiving benefits under them.

## 6. Judgment

* **Final Decision:** The court allowed the appeal and quashed both the arbitration award and the Commercial Court's judgment.
* **Relief Granted:** The court set aside the arbitration award and the Commercial Court's judgment, effectively nullifying the arbitrator's decision and restoring AVVNL's right to pursue UI charges.
* **Orders:** The court directed that the dispute regarding UI charges be resolved through the exclusive redressal mechanism provided under clause 29 of the Regulations of 2004, starting with the State Load Dispatch Center (SLDC).

It reinforces the importance of adhering to the prescribed dispute resolution processes within the specific statutory framework.
