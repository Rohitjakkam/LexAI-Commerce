## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Appellant’s Argument:**
    * The appeal was maintainable under Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, as all matters relating to arbitration fall within the ambit of this Act.
    * The Commercial Courts Act, being a later enactment, overrides the A&C Act.
    * The appellant intended to challenge the order dated 13.03.2020, by filing an appeal under Section 13 of the A&C Act.
    * The appellant argued that there were three awards in its favor against the respondents for which it had filed separate applications seeking enforcement, and these applications should be heard together.
* **Respondent’s Argument:**
    * The appeal was not maintainable under Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, as the order challenged was not one specified in Order XLIII of the CPC or Section 37 of the A&C Act.
    * The appeal was filed against an order passed in proceedings under Section 36 of the A&C Act and was therefore not maintainable under Section 37 of the A&C Act.
    * The amended Section 37 of the A&C Act (with the non-obstante clause) restricts appeals to the orders specified in the section.
    * The appellant was entitled to recover only a sum of Rs. 22,43,55,126/- from the respondents under the three awards, and it was therefore appropriate to withhold this sum from the deposited amount.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The court held that the Commercial Courts Act did not override the A&C Act, and there was no inconsistency between the two Acts.
    * The court applied the principle of "generalia specialibus non derogant" to determine that the A&C Act, being a special Act, prevails over the Commercial Courts Act.
    * The court noted that Section 37 of the A&C Act was amended in 2019, and the non-obstante clause introduced in the provision would prevail over the Commercial Courts Act.
    * The court found that the appeal was directed against an interlocutory order passed in proceedings under Section 36 of the A&C Act, and that no appeal is maintainable from such orders under Section 37 of the A&C Act.
    * The court concluded that the impugned order did not fall under Order XLIII of the CPC or Section 37 of the A&C Act, and therefore the appeal was not maintainable.
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The court interpreted the relevant statutory provisions and precedents to determine the scope and limitations of appeals under the Commercial Courts Act and the A&C Act.
    * The court emphasized the importance of the non-obstante clause introduced in the amended Section 37 of the A&C Act, which limits appealability to the orders specified in the section.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The court applied the relevant legal principles to the facts of the case, considering the specific orders challenged and the relevant statutory provisions.
    * The court applied the principle of "generalia specialibus non derogant" to prioritize the A&C Act, being a special Act, over the Commercial Courts Act.

## 6. Judgment

* **Final Decision:** The appeal was dismissed as not maintainable.
* **Relief Granted:** No relief was granted as the appeal was dismissed.
* **Orders:** The court ordered the dismissal of the appeal.

## 7. Implications

It emphasizes the importance of the non-obstante clause in Section 37 of the A&C Act and reinforces the principle that specific provisions take precedence over general provisions.
* **Future Relevance:** The judgment provides guidance for future cases concerning appeals arising from orders passed under Section 36 of the A&C Act, and it reinforces the importance of carefully analyzing the provisions of both the Commercial Courts Act and the A&C Act in determining the appealability of such orders.
* **Broader Context:** The case highlights the ongoing tension between the desire for expedited resolution of commercial disputes through arbitration and the need to ensure fairness and due process through appeal mechanisms.
