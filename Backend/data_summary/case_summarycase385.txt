    * The Petitioner claimed to have been using the trademark "AMAZE" since 2008 and discovered that the Respondents were selling batteries under the same mark without permission.
    * The Petitioner argued that they had inadvertently omitted certain documents from the initial filing due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on their staff and counsel's ability to work.
    * They argued that the documents were necessary to support their case and rebut the Respondent's claims.
    * The Petitioner emphasized that the suit was still in its early stages and the denial of additional documents could hamper the pursuit of justice.
* **Respondent's Argument:**
    * The Respondents argued that the Petitioner had a duty to disclose all relevant documents with the plaint or within 30 days, as per Order XI Rule 1(1) of CPC.
    * They emphasized that the Petitioner had declared on oath that they had disclosed all documents in their possession, control, and custody at the time of filing the suit.
    * The Respondents cited the Supreme Court judgment in Sudhir Kumar (supra) to argue that the strict provisions of Order XI Rule 1(5) should apply in this case.
    * They argued that the Petitioner had not established a sufficient reason for the non-disclosure of documents and that the COVID-19 pandemic did not justify the delay.

**5. Courtâ€™s Analysis and Reasoning**

* **Key Findings:** 
    * The court found that the Petitioner had not established a separate reason for "non-disclosure" of documents beyond the reasons for "non-filing."
    * The court found that the distinction between "non-disclosure" and "non-filing" was artificial and that the COVID-19 pandemic could constitute a reasonable cause for both.
    * The court found that the Petitioner had made a basic disclosure of the documents in question in the plaint and that the law does not require an exhaustive list of all documents in the pleadings.
    * The court found that the COVID-19 pandemic created extraordinary circumstances that justified the Petitioner's delay in submitting the additional documents.
    * The court found that the documents sought to be introduced by the Petitioner were relevant to the case and were necessary to rebut the Respondent's claims.
    * The court recognized the Respondent's argument regarding its jurisdiction under Article 227 of the Constitution of India but found that the Trial Court's decision contained a manifest error, necessitating intervention.
* **Interpretation of Law:** 
    * The court interpreted Order XI Rule 1(5) of CPC as requiring a reasonable cause for not disclosing documents within the party's possession, control, and custody. 
    * The court found that the COVID-19 pandemic could be a valid reason for not filing documents with the plaint, as recognized by the Supreme Court in Prakash Corporates (supra).
    * The court distinguished the Sudhir Kumar (supra) judgment, noting that it did not put an absolute bar on admitting additional documents and that the circumstances of that case were different.
* **Application of Law:** 
    * The court applied the legal principles regarding disclosure of documents under Order XI of CPC and the discretionary power of the court to admit additional documents.
    * The court considered the unique circumstances of the case, particularly the COVID-19 pandemic, and balanced the need for procedural fairness with the need to prevent undue delays.
    * The court ultimately found that the Petitioner's delay was justified and allowed the admission of additional documents.

**6. Judgment**

* **Relief Granted:** The Impugned Order dated 02nd August, 2022 was set aside. The additional documents were allowed to be taken on record.

It also emphasizes that the court should consider the unique circumstances of each case while applying Order XI Rule 1(5) of CPC.
