**4. Arguments Presented**

* **Petitioner’s Argument:**
    * The order passed under Section 9 of the Arbitration Act by the Commercial Court is an interlocutory order and not a final judgment, hence not appealable under Section 13(1) of the Commercial Courts Act.
    * The heading of Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act refers to “Appeals from decrees” indicating that only final judgments are appealable.
    * The availability of an appeal should not be an absolute bar to the High Court’s power of superintendence under Article 227. 
* **Respondent’s Argument:**
    * Section 13(1) of the Commercial Courts Act clearly states that any person aggrieved by a judgment or order of a Commercial Court below the level of a District Judge can appeal to the Commercial Appellate Court.
    * The heading of Section 13 cannot override the plain wording of the provision.
    * The availability of an effective appeal under the Commercial Courts Act renders the petition under Article 227 unnecessary and unsustainable.

**5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning**

* **Key Findings:**
    * The language of Section 13(1) of the Commercial Courts Act is unambiguous and allows appeals from any judgment or order, including interlocutory orders.
    * The heading of the section cannot control the clear language of the provision.
    * While an alternative remedy through appeal exists, it is not an absolute bar to the High Court’s jurisdiction under Article 227.
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The court emphasized the literal interpretation of Section 13(1) of the Commercial Courts Act, focusing on the words “judgment or order,” and acknowledging that the provision does not explicitly limit appeals to only final judgments.
    * The court highlighted the principle that headings cannot control the meaning of clear and unambiguous provisions.
    * The court recognized that the right of appeal is a substantive right and that its availability does not eliminate the High Court’s supervisory powers.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The court concluded that an order under Section 9 of the Arbitration Act by a Commercial Court below the level of a District Judge is indeed appealable under Section 13(1) of the Commercial Courts Act.
    * The court refrained from exercising its supervisory powers under Article 227 because the petitioners had not provided sufficient justification for not pursuing the available appeal.

**6. Judgment**

* **Final Decision:** The original petition was dismissed.
* **Relief Granted:** No relief was granted as the petition was dismissed.
* **Orders:** The petitioners were directed to explore the option of appeal against the order within the prescribed period.

**7. Implications**

* **Impact on Law:** This judgment clarifies that appeals against orders passed by Commercial Courts under Section 9 of the Arbitration Act are available under Section 13(1) of the Commercial Courts Act. This strengthens the appeal mechanisms within the Commercial Courts framework.
* **Future Relevance:** This case sets a precedent for similar situations where parties seek to challenge interlocutory orders of Commercial Courts. The judgment emphasizes the importance of utilizing available appeal mechanisms before resorting to the High Court’s supervisory powers. 
* **Broader Context:**  The judgment reinforces the significance of statutory provisions and their literal interpretation, particularly when dealing with legal rights like appeal. It also highlights the importance of effective alternative remedies in minimizing unnecessary burdens on the High Court’s supervisory powers.

**8. Summary Points**

* Orders passed by Commercial Courts under Section 9 of the Arbitration Act are appealable under Section 13(1) of the Commercial Courts Act.
* Headings cannot control the clear language of statutory provisions.
