## Arguments Presented

•	**Plaintiff’s Argument:**
    * The allocation of arbitration matters to the Court of Civil Judge Class-I was based on a misinterpretation of the relevant legal provisions.
    * The Arbitration Act designates the Principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction (District Judge or Additional District Judge) as the competent court for arbitration disputes, specifically excluding courts of inferior rank. 
    * The Commercial Courts Act, while establishing Commercial Courts for speedy resolution of commercial disputes, does not override the exclusive jurisdiction of the Principal Civil Court for arbitration matters.
    * The plaintiff cited several precedents supporting his argument, emphasizing the special nature of the Arbitration Act and the need to prioritize the Principal Civil Court's jurisdiction in arbitration cases.
•	**Defendant’s Argument:**
    * Both the Arbitration Act and the Commercial Courts Act aim to expedite dispute resolution. 
    * The Commercial Courts Act allows for the establishment of Commercial Courts at the District Judge level or below, depending on the pecuniary value of the dispute. 
    * The defendant argued that the District Judge or Additional District Judge have the power to exercise the original jurisdiction of a Principal Civil Court, making them competent to handle arbitration matters under the Commercial Courts Act. 
    * The defendant cited case law suggesting that the Commercial Court's jurisdiction in arbitration cases is not barred by the Arbitration Act.

## Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

•	**Key Findings:**
    * The court emphasized the importance of the specific language used in Section 2(1)(e) of the Arbitration Act, which explicitly excludes any civil court of inferior rank from handling arbitration disputes. 
    * The court noted that the Legislature intended to minimize the supervisory role of courts in the arbitral process by granting this jurisdiction to the highest judicial court in a district.
    * The court acknowledged that the Commercial Courts Act aims for speedy resolution of commercial disputes but held that its provisions regarding arbitration matters must be interpreted harmoniously with the Arbitration Act. 
•	**Interpretation of Law:**
    * The court meticulously analyzed the definitions of "Court," "Commercial Court," and "Specified Value" in the relevant statutes. 
    * The court scrutinized the specific provisions of both the Arbitration Act and the Commercial Courts Act concerning the jurisdiction over arbitration matters. 
    * The court considered the precedents cited by both parties and carefully distinguished their applicability to the present case.
•	**Application of Law:**
    * The court applied the doctrine of harmonious construction to interpret the statutes.
    * The court applied the principle of special law prevailing over general law, giving precedence to the Arbitration Act in cases of conflict with the Commercial Courts Act.
    * The court emphasized the exhaustive nature of the definition of "Court" in the Arbitration Act and its implications for determining jurisdiction.

## Judgment

•	**Final Decision:** The court ruled in favor of the petitioner (Yashwardhan Raghuwanshi). 
•	**Relief Granted:** The court set aside Entry No.45 of the impugned order dated 20.10.2020, which had allocated commercial arbitration matters to the Court of Civil Judge Class-I.
•	**Orders:** The court declared that the Court of District Judge, as the Principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction, is solely competent to decide disputes filed under Sections 9, 14, 34, and 36 of the Arbitration Act, regardless of the value of the claim. 

## Implications

•	**Impact on Law:** The judgment clarifies the exclusive jurisdiction of the Principal Civil Court (District Judge or Additional District Judge) in arbitration disputes, emphasizing that courts of inferior rank cannot handle such matters. This reinforces the need to respect the specific provisions of the Arbitration Act and its intent to limit court intervention in arbitral processes.
•	**Future Relevance:** This judgment is likely to have a significant impact on future cases involving the allocation of jurisdiction in arbitration matters under the Commercial Courts Act. It serves as a strong precedent for upholding the exclusive jurisdiction of the Principal Civil Court in such disputes.
•	**Broader Context:** This case highlights the complex interplay between different legal frameworks when resolving commercial disputes, particularly in the context of arbitration. It underscores the importance of interpreting these frameworks harmoniously and giving due respect to the special provisions of the Arbitration Act.

•	The court interpreted the Arbitration Act and the Commercial Courts Act harmoniously, emphasizing the special nature of the Arbitration Act and the need to prioritize the Principal Civil Court's jurisdiction in arbitration cases.
