## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Appellant’s Argument (Welspun):**
    * The trial court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the application under Section 9 of the Act of 1996 because the contracts stipulated that the New Delhi courts had exclusive jurisdiction over any disputes arising from them, including arbitration proceedings.
    * The trial court's grant of the injunction was improper and violated the terms of the agreements.
    * Welspun had already filed a Section 9 application in New Delhi, demonstrating their commitment to the agreed-upon jurisdiction.

* **Respondent’s Argument (Ravi):**
    * The trial court had jurisdiction under Section 9 of the Act of 1996 because the bank guarantee issued by IndusInd Bank, one of the five involved, was located in Udaipur, where the trial court was situated.
    * The order granting the injunction was a valid exercise of the trial court's power under Section 9 to protect Ravi's interests.
    * Welspun's argument about the exclusive jurisdiction clause was based on a narrow interpretation of the contracts and precedents cited by them were not applicable to the present case.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The court found that the appeal was maintainable under Section 37(1)(b) of the Act of 1996, as it challenged an order granting an interim measure under Section 9.
    * The court held that the contracts clearly and unambiguously established that the New Delhi courts had exclusive jurisdiction over all disputes, including arbitration proceedings.
    * The court rejected Ravi's argument that the trial court had jurisdiction based on the location of the bank guarantee, emphasizing that the agreements clearly defined the seat of arbitration as New Delhi.
    * The court found that Welspun's previous Section 9 application in New Delhi strengthened their argument for the exclusive jurisdiction of the New Delhi courts.

* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The court interpreted Section 9 of the Act of 1996 as allowing interim measures, including injunctions, to protect a party's interests during arbitration proceedings.
    * The court interpreted the exclusive jurisdiction clause in the contracts as intending to exclude all other courts except those in New Delhi.
    * The court interpreted the "seat of arbitration" as a concept equivalent to an exclusive jurisdiction clause, granting the courts at the designated seat sole authority over the arbitration proceedings.

* **Application of Law:**
    * The court applied the legal principles of jurisdiction and exclusive jurisdiction to determine that the trial court lacked the authority to entertain the Section 9 application.
    * The court applied the principle of contract interpretation to determine that the parties had intended to exclude all courts except those in New Delhi for resolving their disputes.
    * The court applied precedent from past Supreme Court judgments to support its conclusion regarding the "seat of arbitration" and exclusive jurisdiction.

## 6. Judgment

* **Final Decision:** The appeal was allowed.
* **Relief Granted:** The impugned order granting the injunction was set aside.
* **Orders:** The ad interim injunction granted in the impugned order was to continue for a period of one week from the date of the judgment.

## 7. Implications

* **Impact on Law:** This case reinforces the importance of carefully drafting exclusive jurisdiction clauses in contracts. It also clarifies that the "seat of arbitration" designation in arbitration agreements is tantamount to an exclusive jurisdiction clause.
* **Future Relevance:** This judgment will be influential in future cases involving disputes arising from contracts with exclusive jurisdiction clauses, particularly those involving arbitration. Courts will likely refer to this case when determining whether a specific court has jurisdiction to entertain an application under Section 9 of the Act of 1996.
* **Broader Context:** The judgment highlights the significance of clarity and consistency in contract drafting. It emphasizes the need for parties to clearly define the forum for resolving disputes, especially in complex commercial transactions.

## 8. Summary Points

* The Rajasthan High Court overturned a trial court order that had granted an injunction to prevent Welspun from encashing bank guarantees provided by Ravi.
* The High Court determined that the trial court lacked jurisdiction because the contracts stipulated that disputes, including arbitration proceedings, would be settled in New Delhi courts exclusively.
* The High Court interpreted the "seat of arbitration" as an indication of exclusive jurisdiction, similar to a specific jurisdiction clause.
* The judgment emphasizes the importance of clear and unambiguous contractual language when defining the forum for resolving disputes.
