## Case Title

* **Case Name:** Novateur Electrical & Digital Systems Pvt Ltd vs V-Guard Industries Ltd
* **Court:** Delhi High Court
* **Date of Judgment:** 8th February 2023
* **Citation:** 2023/DHC/000960

## Background and Context

* **Brief Overview:** Novateur Electrical & Digital Systems Pvt Ltd (Plaintiff) filed a suit against V-Guard Industries Ltd (Defendant) alleging that V-Guard infringed upon their registered designs for switch plates (referred to as "suit designs"). The Plaintiff sought an injunction to prevent V-Guard from manufacturing and selling switch plates that allegedly infringed their designs. V-Guard, in their written statement, contested the validity of the Plaintiff's designs, claiming prior publication as a defense against the infringement claim. 
* **Key Issues:**
    * **Maintainability of counterclaim:**  The Plaintiff argued that V-Guard's counterclaim seeking the cancellation of the registered designs was not maintainable under the Designs Act 2000.
    * **Jurisdiction to cancel registered designs:** The Plaintiff asserted that only the Controller of Designs could decide on the cancellation of registered designs, not the High Court.
    * **Effect of Section 22(3) and Section 19 of the Designs Act 2000:**  The Plaintiff claimed that Section 22(3) allowed challenging the registration of designs only as a defense in a piracy suit, while Section 19 provided the exclusive jurisdiction for cancellation petitions with the Controller.

## Arguments Presented

* **Plaintiff's Argument:**
    * The counterclaim seeking cancellation of the registered designs was not maintainable under the Designs Act 2000.
    * The High Court lacked jurisdiction to entertain a petition for cancellation of registered designs, which was the exclusive domain of the Controller of Designs.
    * The defendant had already challenged the validity of the designs in their written statement, thus exhausting their recourse under Section 22(3). 
    * The 2000 Designs Act intentionally separated the procedure for cancellation petitions from piracy suits, and the court should respect this legislative intent.
* **Defendant's Argument:**
    * The Supreme Court's decision in **S.D. Containers Indore v. Mold-Tek Packaging Ltd.** established that a counterclaim seeking cancellation of registered designs was permissible and should be transferred to the High Court. 
    * Section 22(4) of the Designs Act 2000 mandated the transfer of a suit to the High Court when revocation of registration was sought as a defense. 
    * The Defendant had the right to seek cancellation of the designs both through a separate petition to the Controller and as a defense in a piracy suit.

## Courtâ€™s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The facts of the present case were identical to those in **S.D. Containers Indore v. Mold-Tek Packaging Ltd.** 
    * The Supreme Court's judgment in **S.D. Containers** reversed the High Court's decision, confirming that a counterclaim seeking cancellation of a registered design was permissible and required transfer to the High Court.
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The court concluded that the Designs Act 2000 allowed two independent avenues for challenging the registration of a design: 
        * A separate petition to the Controller under Section 19.
        * A counterclaim filed in a piracy suit under Section 22(4).
    * The court emphasized that the Supreme Court's decision in **S.D. Containers** resolved the issue of jurisdiction in such cases.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The court applied the legal principles established by the Supreme Court in **S.D. Containers** to the current case. 
    * The court recognized the binding effect of the Supreme Court's decision as per Article 141 of the Constitution of India.
