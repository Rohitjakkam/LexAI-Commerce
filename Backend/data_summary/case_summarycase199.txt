* **Citation:**  (Citation not available in the provided text)

## Background and Context

**Brief Overview:** The case involves a dispute arising from a construction contract for a Head Race Tunnel in the Maneri Bhali Hydroelectric Project Stage-II in Uttarakhand. The original agreement was signed between the State of Uttar Pradesh and M/s Hydel Construction Private Ltd. (respondent no. 1) in 1981. After the formation of Uttarakhand, a supplementary agreement was signed in 2002, and the work was completed in 2007. A subsequent agreement was made for the construction of a safety wall, but respondent no. 1 failed to complete it within the stipulated time. The matter was referred to arbitration, and the Arbitral Tribunal awarded a sum in favor of respondent no. 1. The State of Uttarakhand (through its successor company, UJVN Ltd.) challenged this award in the Commercial Court, which upheld the award. The State of Uttarakhand then appealed the decision to the High Court. 

**Key Issues:**

* Whether the State of Uttarakhand (represented by UJVN Ltd.) had the right to file a petition under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, to challenge the arbitral award, given that it was not a party to the original agreement or the arbitration proceedings.
* Whether the State of Uttarakhand's appeal against the Commercial Court's decision was maintainable under Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, given the delay in filing the appeal and the acceptance of the arbitral award by UJVN Ltd.
* Whether the Commercial Court's decision to reject the State of Uttarakhand's application for impleadment as a party was correct.

## Arguments Presented

**Appellant’s Argument:**

* UJVN Ltd. was a separate entity from the State of Uttarakhand and was not a party to the original agreement or the arbitration proceedings.
* UJVN Ltd.'s petition under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act was dismissed by the Commercial Court, and no appeal was filed against that decision.
* The State of Uttarakhand, as a party respondent in the Commercial Court proceedings, had accepted the arbitral award by not filing an appeal against it.
* The application for impleadment filed by the State of Uttarakhand was rightly rejected by the Commercial Court, as it was filed beyond the prescribed limitation period.

**Respondent’s Argument:**

* The State of Uttarakhand had contested the arbitral award and should have filed a petition under Section 34 within the prescribed time period.
* The State of Uttarakhand's failure to file a petition under Section 34 within 120 days led to the award becoming final.
* The application for impleadment filed by the State of Uttarakhand was correctly dismissed as it was filed after an unreasonable delay.

## Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

**Key Findings:**

* The court acknowledged that UJVN Ltd. was a separate entity from the State of Uttarakhand and that it had not filed an appeal against the Commercial Court's decision dismissing its petition under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act.
* The court held that the State of Uttarakhand, by not filing an appeal against the arbitral award, had effectively accepted it, even though it had contested the award in the arbitration proceedings.
* The court cited various Supreme Court judgments on the interpretation of the limitation period and condonation of delay provisions in the Arbitration Act and the Commercial Courts Act. 
* The court emphasized the importance of timely filing of appeals and the need for a strict interpretation of "sufficient cause" for condoning delay, particularly in cases involving government entities.
* The court concluded that the State of Uttarakhand's delay in filing the appeal was unjustified and that its application for impleadment was rightly dismissed due to the inordinate delay.

**Interpretation of Law:**

* The court interpreted Section 34(3) of the Arbitration Act and the proviso thereto to hold that the limitation period for filing petitions under Section 34 is 120 days and that this provision is mandatory in nature.
* The court interpreted Section 37 of the Arbitration Act to determine that the State of Uttarakhand's appeal was not maintainable, given that it had effectively accepted the arbitral award by not filing an appeal within the prescribed time period.
* The court interpreted Section 13(1A) of the Commercial Courts Act to determine the applicable limitation period for appeals under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act.

**Application of Law:**

* The court applied the legal principles relating to limitation, condonation of delay, and res judicata to the specific facts of the case.
* The court considered the arguments and evidence presented by both parties, including the precedents cited by them.
* The court applied the principle of res judicata to conclude that the State of Uttarakhand, having not filed an appeal against the Commercial Court's decision dismissing UJVN Ltd.'s petition under Section 34, was barred from challenging the arbitral award again in this appeal.
