## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Scholastic's Argument:**
    * The fire was a force majeure event, terminating the lease.
    * Scholastic was not liable for rent after the Lessor took possession for repairs.
    * Scholastic was not responsible for the fire and should not be liable for repairs.

    * Scholastic was entitled to a refund of the security deposit.
* **Lessor's Argument:**
    * The fire was not a force majeure event that terminated the lease.
    * Scholastic remained liable for rent.
    * Scholastic was negligent and responsible for the fire.
    * The Lessor's claim for repairs was properly supported by evidence, including income tax returns and bank statements.
    * The security deposit should be adjusted against the amount due for repairs.

## 5. Court's Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The Arbitral Tribunal correctly found that Scholastic had not terminated the lease in accordance with the terms of the Lease Deed.
    * The Arbitral Tribunal correctly found that Scholastic was not liable for rent after the Lessor took possession for repairs.
    * The Arbitral Tribunal correctly found that Scholastic was responsible for the fire due to negligence in maintaining electrical equipment.
    * The Arbitral Tribunal's reliance on the Lessor's income tax return and bank statements to determine the cost of repairs was flawed, as these documents lacked a certificate under Section 65B of the Indian Evidence Act.
    * The court accepted that the Arbitral Tribunal had correctly concluded that Scholastic had waived its right to object to the Lessor's failure to obtain insurance coverage.
    * The court determined that the Lessor was entitled to compensation for the damage to the premises under Section 73 of the Indian Contract Act.
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The court emphasized the limited scope of judicial review of arbitral awards under Section 34 of the A&C Act.
    * The court highlighted that an arbitral tribunal is not bound by the Code of Civil Procedure or the Indian Evidence Act.
    * The court stated that an award can be set aside only on grounds of public policy or patent illegality, not for insufficiency of evidence.
    * The court found that the Arbitral Tribunal had erred in relying on the Lessor's income tax return and bank statements without the required certification under Section 65B of the Indian Evidence Act.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The court held that the Lessor's claim for repairs could not be considered entirely unsubstantiated, as the Arbitral Tribunal had acknowledged relevant evidence, including the income tax return and bank statements.
    * The court determined that the Lessor's claim for repairs was not inherently illegal or against public policy.

## 6. Judgment

* **Final Decision:** The Delhi High Court reversed the decision of the Commercial Court. The Lessor's appeal (FAO(COMM) 71/2021) was allowed, and Scholastic's appeal (FAO (COMM) 112/2022) was dismissed.
* **Relief Granted:** The Arbitral Tribunal's award was reinstated, including the compensation awarded to the Lessor for repairs. Scholastic's claim for a refund of the security deposit was dismissed.
* **Orders:**  The parties were left to bear their own costs.

## 7. Implications

* **Impact on Law:** This judgment reaffirms the limited scope of judicial review of arbitral awards under Section 34 of the A&C Act. The court emphasized that courts should avoid re-evaluating evidence and should not set aside awards solely based on concerns about the sufficiency of evidence presented to the arbitral tribunal.
* **Future Relevance:** This case provides guidance on the application of the force majeure doctrine in lease agreements and on the burden of proof for demonstrating damages in arbitration proceedings.
* **Broader Context:** This case highlights the importance of maintaining proper documentation and supporting evidence in contractual disputes, particularly in arbitration proceedings.

## 8. Summary Points

* **Key Takeaways:**
    * Courts should exercise caution in reviewing arbitral awards and avoid re-evaluating evidence. 
    *  Insufficient evidence, alone, is not a sufficient ground for setting aside an arbitral award. 
    *  The Indian Evidence Act and CPC do not apply in arbitration proceedings, but arbitral awards can still be challenged based on public policy or patent illegality.
    *  Income tax returns and bank statements can be relevant evidence in arbitration proceedings, but they may require additional certification or corroboration to establish liability.
