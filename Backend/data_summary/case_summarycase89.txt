## Arguments Presented

* **Appellant’s Argument:** The Appellant argued that they had no intention to participate in the Commercial Court proceedings and that their failure to file a written statement did not constitute a waiver of their right to arbitration. They relied on the arbitration clause in their purchase order and cited various Single Bench decisions of the Delhi High Court that supported their interpretation of Section 8.
* **Respondent’s Argument:**  The Respondent did not present any arguments as they were not represented in court during the hearing.

## Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:** The court found that:
    * The expression "not later than the date of" introduced in Section 8(1) of the A&C Act by the 2015 amendment provided a clear time frame for filing an application under Section 8.
    * The contemporaneous amendment to Order VIII Rule 1 of the CPC further supported the interpretation that the application under Section 8(1) must be filed within the time limit for filing the written statement. 
    * Once the right to file the written statement was closed, the proceedings had progressed beyond the stage of completion of pleadings, making it no longer permissible for a party to seek reference to arbitration. 
* **Interpretation of Law:** The court emphasized that the 2015 amendment to the A&C Act, along with the amendments to the CPC, reflected a legislative intent to streamline and expedite commercial dispute resolution through arbitration. 
* **Application of Law:** The court applied its interpretation of Section 8 and the legislative intent to the facts of the case. The Appellant's failure to file a written statement within the stipulated time and their subsequent application under Section 8 after the right to do so was closed was considered a forfeiture of their right to seek arbitration.

## Judgment

* **Final Decision:** The Delhi High Court upheld the decision of the Commercial Court, dismissing the Appellant's appeal.
* **Relief Granted:**  The court granted no relief to the Appellant.
* **Orders:** The court dismissed the appeal and disposed of the pending application.

## Implications

* **Impact on Law:** This judgment clarified the interpretation of Section 8 of the A&C Act in light of the 2015 amendments. It established that the time frame for filing an application under Section 8(1) is limited to the time available for filing the first statement on the substance of the dispute, which includes the written statement.
* **Future Relevance:** This case serves as a precedent for future cases involving applications under Section 8 of the A&C Act, particularly in commercial disputes. It reinforces the importance of timely action and highlights the consequences of missing deadlines in arbitration proceedings.
* **Broader Context:** The judgment emphasizes the court's commitment to upholding the legislative intent of the 2015 amendments, which aimed to promote efficient and timely dispute resolution through arbitration.

## Summary Points

* The Appellant’s failure to file a written statement within the stipulated time resulted in the forfeiture of their right to apply for arbitration under Section 8 of the A&C Act.
* The court interpreted the 2015 amendment to Section 8(1) of the A&C Act and its relation to the concurrent amendment to the CPC as establishing a time limit for applications under Section 8.
