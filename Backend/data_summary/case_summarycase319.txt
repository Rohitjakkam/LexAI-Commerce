## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Appellant’s Argument (KCTL):**
    * The Commercial Court, Rajkot, lacked jurisdiction to entertain the execution petition. 
    * The Division Bench's decision in M/s.OCI Corporation (I) (supra) established that the Commercial Division of the High Court was the proper venue for executing international arbitral awards, regardless of whether the award was domestic or foreign.
    * The learned Judge erred in distinguishing between domestic and foreign awards, as even a domestic award arising from international arbitration should be handled by the Commercial Division.
    * The appeal under Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, was maintainable.
* **Respondent’s Argument (Doosan):**
    * The appeal against the Commercial Court's order was not maintainable under Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, as the impugned order was not specifically enumerated under Order XLIII of the Code or Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. 
    * The decision in M/s.OCI Corporation (I) (supra) was inapplicable because the award in that case was a foreign award, while the present case involved a domestic award.
    * The Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015, should not be applied retrospectively to arbitration proceedings commenced prior to its enactment.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The court recognized that the decision in M/s.OCI Corporation (I) (supra) was binding precedent on the issue of jurisdiction in international arbitral awards.
    * The court found that the Commercial Court, Rajkot, had erred in distinguishing between domestic and foreign awards, as the key consideration was the international nature of the arbitration.
    * The court agreed that the appeal under Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, was not maintainable.
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The court interpreted Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, to confirm that appeals were generally allowed from final judgments of the Commercial Court or Commercial Division of the High Court.
    * The court clarified that the proviso to Section 13(1) did not restrict appeals to only those specifically enumerated under Order XLIII of the Code or Section 37 of the Arbitration Act.
    * The court confirmed that execution petitions arising from international commercial arbitration, regardless of the award's origin, must be filed in the Commercial Division of the High Court.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The court applied the binding precedent established in M/s.OCI Corporation (I) (supra) to the present case, concluding that the Commercial Court, Rajkot, lacked jurisdiction to handle the execution petition.
    * The court emphasized that the primary consideration was the international nature of the arbitration, not the origin of the award (domestic or foreign).
