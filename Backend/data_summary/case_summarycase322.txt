## Case Title

* **Case Name:** Dan Bunkering Limited vs PFS Shipping India Limited
* **Court:** Bombay High Court, Admiralty and Vice-Admiralty Jurisdiction
* **Date of Judgment:** 21st June 2018
* **Citation:** AIRONLINE 2018 BOM 1009

## Background and Context

**Brief Overview:**

Dan Bunkering Limited (Plaintiff) filed a suit seeking payment of US$ 163,089.65 plus interest from PFS Shipping India Limited (Defendant). The claim stemmed from a judgment passed by the Supreme Court of Denmark confirming a prior judgment by the Maritime and Commercial Court, Copenhagen. 

This case originated from a charterparty agreement between PFS Shipping India Limited and Britannia Bulk PLC, where PFS Shipping India Limited leased its vessel PFS NARAYANA. Britannia Bulk PLC placed an order with Dan Bunkering Limited for bunker supply, but subsequently went insolvent. Dan Bunkering Limited, unable to recover payment, arrested the vessel in Amsterdam.  A Settlement Agreement was reached, but PFS Shipping India Limited failed to fulfill its obligations.
