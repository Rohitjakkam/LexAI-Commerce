## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Petitioner’s Argument:**
    * The GAFTA awards are enforceable in India under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, as they have attained finality in England.
    * The Indian court should not review the merits of the awards, including the quantum of damages, as the parties agreed to be governed by English law, and the awards were upheld by English courts.
    * The award does not violate the fundamental policy of Indian law, morality, or justice, and therefore should be deemed a decree of the Indian court.
* **Respondent’s Argument:** 
    * The awards are not enforceable in India because they are contrary to public policy, morality, and justice.
    * The damages awarded are excessive and result in unjust enrichment for the petitioner, exceeding actual losses.
    * The award violates the principles of Indian contract law, particularly Section 73 of the Indian Contract Act, which prohibits profiteering from breach of contract.
    * The High Court of Justice Queen's Division Commercial Court did not fully confirm the awards, but only refused to overturn them on the grounds that they were not "obviously wrong."
    * The award is punitive in nature and shocks the conscience of the Indian court.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The court found that the GAFTA awards had attained finality in England. 
    * The court acknowledged the limited scope of inquiry under Section 48 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, which does not allow a review of the merits of the dispute in the enforcement stage.
    * The court found that the parties had agreed to be governed by English law, and the GAFTA awards were based on the provisions of the UK Sale of Goods Act.
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The court interpreted "public policy" in the context of foreign awards narrowly, as established in the Supreme Court's decisions in Renusagar Power Co. Ltd. vs. General Electric Co. and Shri Lal Mahal Ltd. vs. Progetto Grano SPA.
    * The court interpreted the provisions of Section 48 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, to mean that the Indian court cannot review the merits of a foreign award at the enforcement stage. 
    * The court interpreted Section 73 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, to be irrelevant in the context of a foreign award governed by English law.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The court applied the principles of public policy and unjust enrichment as developed in the Indian legal system.
    * The court recognized that the parties had chosen English law to govern their contract and the arbitration proceedings, and thus, the Indian court should not interfere with the findings of the English courts. 
    * The court declined to review the amount of damages awarded, finding that the respondent's objections were based on the merits of the dispute, which are not subject to review under Section 48 of the Act.

## 6. Judgment

* **Final Decision:** The court found in favor of the petitioner and deemed the GAFTA awards to be enforceable in India, effectively making them decrees of the Gujarat High Court.
* **Relief Granted:** The court ordered the parties to complete pleadings and set a date for further hearing to determine the remaining aspects of the execution process.
* **Orders:** The court ordered the execution petitions to be listed for further hearing on 11th September 2017.

## 7. Implications

* **Impact on Law:** The judgment reaffirms the principle of finality and enforceability of foreign awards in India, provided they meet the conditions outlined in Section 48 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. 
* **Future Relevance:** This judgment will likely serve as precedent in future cases involving the enforcement of foreign awards in India, particularly where the parties have agreed to be governed by a foreign legal system. 
* **Broader Context:** This judgment highlights the increasing importance of international commercial arbitration and the need for efficient and predictable enforcement of foreign awards. It also underscores the importance of careful consideration of the applicable law and the seat of arbitration in international contracts.

## 8. Summary Points

* The Gujarat High Court upheld the enforceability of GAFTA arbitration awards upheld by English courts in India.
* The court applied a narrow interpretation of the "public policy" exception to enforceability of foreign awards under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.
* The court emphasized that Indian courts cannot review the merits of a foreign award at the enforcement stage, especially when the parties have agreed to be governed by a foreign legal system.
* The court declined to consider the respondent's arguments regarding the excessiveness of the damages awarded, as they amounted to a review of the merits of the case.
* The judgment underscores the importance of careful consideration of the applicable law and the seat of arbitration in international contracts.
