## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Plaintiff's Argument:**
    * The dispute arose from a joint venture agreement, qualifying as a "commercial dispute" under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015.
    * The decision of the Appeal Court classifying the dispute as commercial triggered automatic application of the Commercial Courts Act, including the amended provisions of Order VIII Rule 1 of the CPC regarding the filing of written statements.
    * The court's failure to consider these amended provisions constituted an "error apparent on the face of the record" warranting review. 
* **Defendant's Argument:**
    * The plaintiff failed to initiate the transfer of the suit to the Commercial Division under Section 15 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015.
    * The defendants were actively contesting the suit and had already participated in proceedings prior to the application for extensions of time.
    * The error, if any, was not "apparent on the face of the record" and required a detailed examination of the legal position. 
    * The proviso to Section 15(4) of the Commercial Courts Act preserved the court's discretion to extend the time for filing written statements in transferred commercial suits.

## 5. Court's Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The court found that the plaintiff failed to take the necessary steps under Section 15(5) of the Commercial Courts Act to transfer the suit to the Commercial Division. 
    * The court held that the error alleged by the plaintiff was not "apparent on the face of the record" and required a lengthy and involved analysis of the law.
    * The court interpreted the proviso to Section 15(4) of the Commercial Courts Act as preserving the court's discretion to extend the time for filing written statements in commercial suits. 
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The court interpreted the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 as requiring the plaintiff to initiate the transfer of the suit to the Commercial Division under Section 15(5).
    * The court found that the plaintiff's argument that the Commercial Courts Act applied automatically without the plaintiff's action was incorrect. 
    * The court interpreted "shall not apply" in the proviso to Section 15(4) as preserving the defendant's right to file written statements within a reasonable timeframe, even in transferred commercial suits.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The court applied the principles of review jurisdiction under Order XLVII of the CPC, finding that the alleged error was not "apparent on the face of the record" but required a detailed examination of the facts and law.
    * The court applied the principles established in various precedents, finding that a review was not a mechanism for a rehearing of the case on merits.

## 6. Judgment

* **Final Decision:** The court dismissed the plaintiff's applications for review of the orders granting extensions of time to the defendants to file their written statements.
* **Relief Granted:** No specific relief was granted.
* **Orders:** The court ordered that the review applications be dismissed without any order as to costs. 

## 7. Implications

    * This judgment clarifies the application of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 in cases where suits were filed before the Act's enactment.
    * The judgment confirms that the plaintiff bears the responsibility for initiating the transfer of a suit to the Commercial Division under Section 15(5) of the Act.
