* **Legal Doctrines:** 
    * **Cause of Action:** The court examined whether the plaint contained sufficient information about the alleged wrongdoing by the defendant, including the date of the events, the nature of the actions, and the resulting harm.
    * **Secondary Evidence:** The court analyzed the admissibility of secondary evidence under Section 65 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. This doctrine governs when copies of documents can be used in court if the original documents are unavailable.
    * **Notice:** The court considered the requirements of Section 66 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, which deals with the requirement of notice to the opposing party before presenting secondary evidence.

**4. Arguments Presented**

* **Plaintiff’s Argument (M/S Hira Ram Hansa Ram):**
    * The respondent argued that the plaint sufficiently disclosed a cause of action, as it clearly outlined the alleged fraud committed by the petitioner by not remitting the collected money.
    * The respondent claimed that the original receipts for the payments made by traders were in the possession of the petitioner, and therefore, it was justified in seeking admission of secondary evidence under Section 65 of the Evidence Act.
    * The respondent argued that the application under Order XI Rule 12 and 14 of CPC was a different procedure for discovery and inspection of documents and did not preclude it from seeking secondary evidence under Section 65.
    * The respondent claimed that the petitioner was aware of the respondent's intent to present the photostat copies of the receipts and therefore, notice under Section 66 was not required.

* **Defendant’s Argument (M/S Triveni Brokers):**
    * The petitioner argued that the plaint did not disclose a cause of action as it lacked specific details about the transactions, including the names of the buyers.
    * The petitioner argued that the respondent failed to fulfill the requirements of Section 65 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, as it did not prove the original receipts were lost or destroyed.
    * The petitioner argued that the respondent could not seek secondary evidence under Section 65 after the application under Order XI Rule 12 and 14 of the CPC was dismissed.
    * The petitioner argued that the respondent failed to provide proper notice under Section 66 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, before presenting the secondary evidence. 

**5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning**

* **Key Findings:**
    * The court found that the respondent's plaint contained sufficient details about the transactions and the alleged fraud committed by the petitioner, thus disclosing a cause of action. 
    * The court determined that the respondent had taken sufficient steps to obtain the original receipts by filing an application under Order XI Rule 12 and 14 of the CPC, even though it was dismissed. 
    * The court observed that the original receipts were likely in the possession of the petitioner, fulfilling the requirements of Section 65 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.
    * The court ruled that the petitioner was aware of the respondent's intent to present secondary evidence and therefore, notice under Section 66 was not required.
    
* **Interpretation of Law:** The court interpreted the relevant provisions of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, and the CPC in light of previous judgments cited by both parties. The court focused on the distinction between discovery and inspection procedures (Order XI Rule 12 and 14) and the admission of secondary evidence (Section 65). 
* **Application of Law:** The court applied the relevant legal principles to the specific facts of the case, finding that the respondent had fulfilled the necessary conditions to present secondary evidence and that the plaint disclosed a cause of action.

**6. Judgment**

* **Final Decision:** The Rajasthan High Court dismissed both writ petitions filed by the petitioner, upholding the orders of the Commercial Court. 
* **Relief Granted:** The court did not grant any specific relief to the respondent, as the petitioner's attempt to challenge the orders of the Commercial Court was unsuccessful.
* **Orders:** The court ordered the dismissal of both writ petitions, as well as all pending applications related to the case.

**7. Implications**

* **Impact on Law:** The judgment reaffirms the requirements for disclosing a cause of action in a plaint and the conditions under which secondary evidence can be presented in court. It clarifies the application of Order XI Rule 12 and 14 of the CPC and Section 65 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, in similar situations.
* **Future Relevance:** This case provides a useful precedent for similar disputes involving allegations of fraud and the use of secondary evidence in commercial suits.
* **Broader Context:** The judgment underscores the importance of proper documentation in commercial transactions and highlights the role of courts in ensuring that parties are provided a fair opportunity to present their evidence.
