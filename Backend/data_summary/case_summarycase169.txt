## 4. Arguments Presented

* **AMNS’ Argument:** 
    * The petitioner argued that once an Arbitral Tribunal is constituted, the Court should not "entertain" any further applications under Section 9(1) of the Act, unless it finds that the remedy under Section 17 is inefficacious. 
    *  They argued that the word "entertain" in Section 9(3) should be interpreted broadly, encompassing the entire adjudication process, including the passing of a final order.
    * They contended that the Court's role is limited to assisting the arbitration process, emphasizing the principle of party autonomy.
    *  They cited several judgments from the Calcutta High Court, Bombay High Court, and Delhi High Court in support of their interpretation of Section 9(3) and the principle of "Court-Subsidiarity".
    * They argued that the application for interim measures filed by EBTL could be adjudicated by the Arbitral Tribunal and that there was no urgency for the Court to continue with the proceedings.
* **EBTL’s Argument:** 
    * The respondent argued that the petitioner's petition was premature, as the Commercial Court had not yet made a decision regarding the interim applications under Section 9. 
    * They contended that the Court's jurisdiction was not ousted by the constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal and that Section 9(3) merely restricted the Court's power to entertain such applications.
    * They argued that the word "entertain" should be interpreted narrowly, focusing on the Court's initial consideration of the application and not extending to the pronouncement of the judgment.
    * They emphasized the urgency of their situation, as AMNS had stopped paying charges for using EBTL's jetty facilities, leading to a financial crunch.
    * They argued that the petitioner was abusing the legal process by trying to delay proceedings and avoid addressing the urgency of the respondent's application.
    * They cited several judgments, including those of the Delhi High Court, in support of their interpretation of Section 9(3) and the Court's continuing jurisdiction.
    * They highlighted the importance of allowing the Commercial Court to pronounce its decision, considering the time already spent on the proceedings and the potential for a longer delay if the matter was referred to the Arbitral Tribunal. 

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:** 
    * The Court acknowledged the general principle of "Court-Subsidiarity" in international arbitration practice, where Courts should defer to the arbitral process.
    *  The Court recognized that the Arbitration Act is a complete code in itself, limiting judicial intervention to specific situations outlined in the Act. 
    * The Court agreed that the word "entertain" in Section 9(3) should not be interpreted in a narrow sense, but it also recognized that Section 9(3) did not completely oust the Court's jurisdiction.
* **Interpretation of Law:** 
    * The Court interpreted Section 9(3) of the Act as imposing a restriction on the Court's power to entertain applications under Section 9(1) after the Arbitral Tribunal is constituted.
    * The Court acknowledged that the Court could still entertain applications under Section 9(1) if it found that the remedy under Section 17 was not efficacious. 
    * The Court held that the phrase "entertain an application" encompassed the entire adjudication process, including the passing of a final order on merits.
* **Application of Law:** 
    * The Court applied the interpretation of Section 9(3) to the specific facts of the case, finding that the Commercial Court had already heard the applications under Section 9 and was in the process of deciding them.
    * The Court found that the Commercial Court had not yet determined whether the remedy under Section 17 was efficacious and therefore had not violated Section 9(3) of the Act. 
    * The Court recognized that the Arbitral Tribunal was constituted after the hearing of the Section 9 applications, and therefore the Commercial Court could still decide the applications.
    * The Court held that the petitioner's application seeking to refer the entire dispute to the Arbitral Tribunal was premature and beyond the scope of Section 9, as it was intended for interim measures only. 

## 6. Judgment

* **Final Decision:** The Gujarat High Court dismissed the petitioner's petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. 
* **Relief Granted:** No relief was granted to the petitioner.
* **Orders:** 
    * The Court granted the petitioner's request to amend the petition to remove the prayer for a writ of certiorari.
    * The Court directed the Commercial Court at Surat to continue with the proceedings and pronounce its order on the Section 9 applications filed by both parties.
    * The Court stayed the pronouncement of the Commercial Court's order for a period of three weeks to enable the petitioner to approach the Supreme Court.

## 7. Implications

* **Impact on Law:**  The judgment further clarifies the interpretation of Section 9(3) of the Arbitration Act, recognizing that the Court's power to entertain interim applications is not completely ousted after the constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal.  The judgment emphasizes the importance of considering the efficacy of the remedy under Section 17 in such cases.
* **Future Relevance:** The judgment will likely be used as precedent in future cases involving similar issues, particularly in disputes arising from arbitration agreements and the interpretation of the Court's role in such matters.
* **Broader Context:** The case reflects the ongoing debate regarding the appropriate balance between court intervention and the autonomy of the arbitration process in India. 

## 8. Summary Points

* **Key Takeaways:**
    * Section 9(3) of the Arbitration Act does not completely oust the Court's jurisdiction to entertain interim applications under Section 9(1) after the constitution of an Arbitral Tribunal. 
    *  The Court's power to entertain such applications is restricted, requiring it to determine whether the remedy under Section 17 is efficacious. 
    *  The word "entertain" in Section 9(3) should be interpreted broadly, covering the entire adjudication process. 
    *  The Court should not interfere with the arbitral process unless there are exceptional circumstances or bad faith demonstrated. 
    *  Parties should primarily rely on the arbitral process for interim measures once the Arbitral Tribunal is constituted, with the Court playing a supporting role.
