## Arguments Presented

**Plaintiff’s Argument (Hotel Goradias Pvt. Ltd.):**

* The dispute is of a commercial nature and thus falls under the jurisdiction of the Commercial Court.
* The Appellant is a private limited company with share capital exceeding Rs. 2 Crore, rendering the Maharashtra Rent Control Act inapplicable.
* The Appellant is in illegal occupation of the property, having failed to pay rent for several months, and the Respondent is entitled to possession.
* The Appellant's objections regarding the Commercial Court's jurisdiction and the pre-institution mediation requirement are without merit and were not raised before the trial court.

**Defendant’s Argument (Lord Sai Maa Pvt. Ltd.):**

* The Commercial Court lacks jurisdiction due to the applicability of the Maharashtra Rent Control Act, which vests exclusive jurisdiction in a designated authority.
* The Respondent's claim for possession is barred by the law of limitation as the cause of action arose several years ago.
* The Commercial Court erred in granting interim mandatory injunction, essentially granting final relief at an interim stage.
* The Appellant is entitled to equitable relief considering the substantial renovation expenses incurred and the lack of pre-institution mediation.

**Key Findings:**

* The Commercial Court has jurisdiction to hear the case, as the dispute involves a commercial transaction and the Appellant's share capital exceeds Rs. 2 Crore, making the Maharashtra Rent Control Act inapplicable.
* The Appellant's objections regarding jurisdiction and pre-institution mediation were not raised before the trial court and are therefore considered waived.
* The Respondent's claim for possession is not barred by the law of limitation, as the suit is not specifically for mandatory injunction.
* The court found that while the Appellant had incurred significant renovation expenses, it had also failed to pay rent for a considerable period.

**Interpretation of Law:**

* The court interpreted Section 12-A of the Commercial Courts Act as directory rather than mandatory, meaning it is a guideline but not a strict requirement.
* The court interpreted Article 113 of the Limitation Act as inapplicable in this case, as the suit is not solely for mandatory injunction.

**Application of Law:**

* The court applied the principle of equity, considering the interests of both parties and balancing their claims.
* The court exercised its inherent powers to modify the interim mandatory injunction, taking into account the facts and circumstances of the case.

* The Respondent was entitled to withdraw the amount deposited by the Appellant.
* The Appellant's application for temporary injunction (Exh. 57) was dismissed.
