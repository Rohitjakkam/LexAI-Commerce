## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Plaintiff’s Argument (Non-applicant/Petitioner):** 
    * The respondents filed their written statement and affidavit of admission and denial with excessive delay without a valid application for condonation of delay. 
    * The Original Side Rules are applicable to Commercial Courts, and the respondents failed to comply with the procedural requirements of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015.
    * The respondent’s belated filing was not justifiable, and the Commercial Court erred in condoning the delay.
    * The Commercial Court should have proceeded under Order VIII Rule 10 CPC due to the respondents' failure to comply with the procedural requirements. 
* **Defendant’s Argument (Applicants/Respondents):**
    * The High Court erred in interpreting the facts and law in its judgment.
    * The plaintiff failed to properly quantify the claim and pay the required court fees, making the plaint invalid before the written statement was filed.
    * The Original Side Rules are not applicable to District Courts, including Commercial Courts. 
    * The court's requirement for an application for condonation of delay constitutes an impermissible legislative incursion.
    * The Court's judgment unfairly curtailed the Commercial Court's powers under Order VIII Rule 5 and Order VII Rule 11 CPC.
    * The judgment in Red Bull AG (supra) supported the argument that an application for condonation of delay is not always necessary for accepting belatedly filed written statements.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:** 
    * The Original Side Rules are applicable to Commercial Courts, as the Practice Directions issued under Section 18 of the Commercial Courts Act explicitly supplement the Original Side Rules for commercial disputes in District Courts.
    * The Court found no merit in the respondents' claim that an application for condonation of delay is not necessary. The court relied on several previous judgments, including Unilin Beheer B.V. (supra), Rajesh Goel (supra), Shreeved Consultancy LLP (supra), and Mothers Pride Education Institution Pvt. Ltd. (supra), to support its position. 
    * The Court rejected the respondents' argument regarding the invalidity of the plaint due to the late payment of court fees, as the payment was made after objections raised by the respondents, not due to a court order.
    * The Court upheld the previous judgment regarding the application of Order VIII Rule 10 CPC to the case.
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The Court emphasized the need for strict adherence to procedural rules and timelines under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015.
    * The Court interpreted the provisions of the Commercial Courts Act and the Original Side Rules to be applicable to Commercial Courts at the District level.
    * The Court found that the requirement of an application for condonation of delay, when filing a written statement with delay, is a well-established practice supported by numerous precedents.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The Court applied the relevant legal principles and precedents to the specific facts of the case.
    * The Court found that the respondents failed to comply with the statutory requirements regarding the filing of a written statement and the application for condonation of delay.
    * The Court applied the principle of judicial review, holding that the Commercial Court's order accepting the belated written statement was an error apparent on the face of the record.

## 6. Judgment

* **Final Decision:** The review petition filed by the respondents was dismissed.
* **Relief Granted:** None, except the dismissal of the review petition. 
* **Orders:** The Court imposed costs of Rs.10,000/- on the respondents, to be shared equally between the petitioner and Bharat Key Vir Funds.
