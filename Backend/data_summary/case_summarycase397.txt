## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Plaintiff’s Argument:**
    * The original plaintiff argued that the defendant consumed the goods supplied without dispute, failed to honor 90 cheques, and had not raised timely objections to the conditional leave order.
    * They contended that the defendant's defenses were not genuine and were raised as an afterthought.
    * They asserted that the invoices contained the interest clause and the defendant had not disputed it.
    * They emphasized the need for expeditious disposal of commercial cases and argued that the defendant's behavior displayed bad faith.
* **Defendant’s Argument:**
    * The original defendant claimed that the suit was not maintainable under Order XXXVII of the CPC due to the absence of a written contract.
    * They argued that the annual agreement upon which the suit was based was not signed by the defendant and was therefore, invalid.
    * They challenged the authority of the person who filed the suit on behalf of the original plaintiff.
    * They argued that the plaintiff had initiated a separate suit for redemption of mortgage in the Bombay High Court, which demonstrated they had not acted in good faith.
    * They disputed the claim for interest, arguing that there was no contractual obligation to pay interest at the claimed rate.
    * They also asserted that certain claims were time-barred.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The court found that the original defendant had failed to deposit the required amount of Rs. 5 Crores within the time given by the court while granting conditional leave to defend.
    * The court considered the original defendant's application for an extension of time and found that the defendant had accepted the order of conditional leave at that time.
    * The court acknowledged that there were triable issues raised by the defendant, but questioned the good faith of these defenses given the circumstances of the case, especially the defendant's failure to dispute the goods or invoices earlier.
* **Interpretation of Law:** 
    * The court relied heavily on the Supreme Court's decision in IDBI Trusteeship Services Limited vs. Hubtown Limited (2017) 1 SCC 568. 
    * The court interpreted the ruling in Hubtown Limited as superseding the principles laid down in Mechelec Engineers and Manufacturers vs. Basic Equipment Corporation (1976) 4 SCC 687. 
    * The court clarified that the principle of granting unconditional leave to defend solely based on triable issues was no longer the sole determinant. 
    * The court emphasized that the trial court could impose conditions like deposit or security if there were doubts about the defendant's good faith or the genuineness of their claims.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The court applied the principles from Hubtown Limited and held that the original defendant's defenses were not genuine and lacked good faith, especially considering the defendant's prior acceptance of the conditional leave order and their failure to dispute the invoices or consumption of goods earlier.
    * The court also considered the defendant's argument regarding the absence of a written contract but held that the invoices and subsequent conduct of the parties constituted a valid "written contract" for the purpose of summary suit. 
    * The court found that the defendant's objection to the authority of the person filing the suit was baseless, as the authority letter was on record.
    * The court dismissed the defendant's argument about the dual action before the Bombay High Court as it was unrelated to the current claim. 
    * The court found that the interest clause in the invoices was sufficient to support the plaintiff's claim for interest.

## 6. Judgment

* **Final Decision:** The Gujarat High Court dismissed both the First Appeal and the Special Civil Application filed by the original defendant (Modipon Fibres Company).
* **Relief Granted:** No relief was granted to the defendant. The judgment upheld the Commercial Court's decision. 
* **Orders:** The court dismissed the petitions with no order as to costs.

## 7. Implications

* **Impact on Law:** The judgment reinforces the Supreme Court's ruling in Hubtown Limited, emphasizing that the existence of triable issues alone does not automatically guarantee unconditional leave to defend in summary suits. The court can impose conditions like deposit or security if it finds that the defendant's defenses lack good faith or are not genuine. 
* **Future Relevance:** The judgment provides guidance for future cases concerning conditional leave to defend in summary suits, particularly when the defendant's prior actions suggest a lack of good faith.
* **Broader Context:** This case highlights the importance of acting in good faith in legal proceedings, especially in commercial disputes. It emphasizes that the courts will scrutinize defenses to ensure that they are genuine and not designed to delay proceedings or avoid financial obligations.

## 8. Summary Points

* The Gujarat High Court upheld the Commercial Court's decision to grant conditional leave to defend to the original defendant in a summary suit, requiring the defendant to deposit Rs. 5 Crores.
* The court found that the defendant's defenses lacked good faith, especially considering their failure to dispute the invoices or consumption of goods earlier and their prior acceptance of the conditional leave order.
* The judgment reinforces the Supreme Court's decision in Hubtown Limited, emphasizing the court's ability to impose conditions to ensure fairness and expedite proceedings.
* The case highlights the importance of acting in good faith in legal proceedings and discourages delaying tactics by defendants in commercial disputes.
