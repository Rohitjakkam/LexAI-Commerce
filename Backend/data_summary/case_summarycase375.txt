* **Key Findings:**
    * The court observed that no Commercial Court had been established at the District level.
    * The court interpreted Section 7 of the Act, particularly its first proviso, and held that it did not apply to suits pending before a Court inferior to the Court of District Judge.

* **Interpretation of Law:** The court interpreted the provisions of the Act, particularly Section 7 and 15(2), in light of the objective of the Act, which is to ensure the speedy disposal of commercial disputes. The court stressed that the Act does not aim to render a litigant remediless.
