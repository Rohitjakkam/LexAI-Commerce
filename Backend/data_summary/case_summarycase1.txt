* **Legal Doctrines:**

    * Doctrine of Kompetenz-Kompetenz: The arbitral tribunal has the competence to determine its own jurisdiction, including objections about the existence, validity, and scope of the arbitration agreement.

## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Plaintiff’s Argument (Global Mercantile):**
    * The Work Order, being unstamped, is not enforceable under the Stamp Act and therefore, the arbitration clause embedded in it is also unenforceable.
    * The invocation of the bank guarantee was fraudulent since no work was performed, and Indo Unique had not suffered any loss.
    * The High Court erred in allowing the application under Section 8 of the Arbitration Act as it enforced a non-existent arbitration clause.
* **Defendant’s Argument (Indo Unique):**
    * The Work Order is enforceable after it is duly stamped.
    * Non-payment of stamp duty is a curable defect.
    * The arbitration agreement is independent and enforceable even if the Work Order is unstamped.
    * The allegations of fraud are simple and not complex, and the disputes can be resolved through arbitration.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The doctrine of separability and Kompetenz-Kompetenz applies, making the arbitration agreement independent and capable of surviving the invalidity of the underlying contract.
    * An arbitration agreement is not chargeable to stamp duty under the Maharashtra Stamp Act, 1958.
    * Non-payment of stamp duty on the Work Order does not invalidate the main contract. 
    * The court held that allegations of fraud are arbitrable unless they are so serious as to constitute a virtual case of criminal offence, or the fraud permeates the entire contract, including the arbitration clause.
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The court extensively analyzed the principles of separability and Kompetenz-Kompetenz, citing several precedents from India and England. 
    * It meticulously examined the provisions of the Maharashtra Stamp Act, 1958, emphasizing the distinction between the admissibility of an instrument and its enforceability.
    * The court considered the evolution of the law regarding the arbitrability of fraud, noting the shift away from a strict interpretation.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The court applied the doctrine of separability to hold that the non-payment of stamp duty on the Work Order would not invalidate the arbitration clause.
    * It distinguished the impact of non-payment of stamp duty from the impact of non-registration under the Registration Act, finding that the former is a curable defect.
    * The court applied the principle that civil fraud is generally arbitrable, rejecting the earlier reasoning based on the complexity of evidence.

## 6. Judgment

* **Final Decision:** The Supreme Court set aside the judgment of the Bombay High Court which had allowed the application under Section 8 of the Arbitration Act.
* **Relief Granted:** The court directed the Secretary General of the Supreme Court to impound the Work Order and forward it to the concerned Collector for assessment of stamp duty.
* **Orders:**
    * The Appellant (Global Mercantile) was directed to pay the stamp duty assessed by the Collector within four weeks of receiving the communication.
    * The Appellant was permitted to seek interim relief under Section 9 of the Arbitration Act regarding the invocation of the bank guarantee.
    * The stay granted by the High Court was extended for eight weeks.
    * The court referred the issue of whether a statutory bar on an unstamped instrument impacts the enforceability of the arbitration clause contained within it, to a Constitution Bench for authoritative settlement.

## 7. Implications

* **Impact on Law:**
    * The judgment clarified the application of the doctrine of separability of arbitration agreements in the context of unstamped contracts, holding that such agreements remain enforceable.
    * It affirmed that allegations of fraud are generally arbitrable, subject to specific exceptions.
    * The court also addressed the question of maintainability of Writ Petitions challenging orders refusing to refer parties to arbitration.
* **Future Relevance:**
    * This case will be a valuable precedent for future cases involving unstamped contracts and arbitration agreements.
    * The court's reasoning on the arbitrability of fraud is likely to be influential in future cases dealing with similar disputes.
* **Broader Context:**
    * The judgment reinforces the trend towards recognizing the autonomy and effectiveness of arbitration as a dispute resolution mechanism in India.
    * It demonstrates the court's willingness to interpret statutory provisions in a manner that promotes efficiency and minimizes unnecessary litigation.

## 8. Summary Points

* The doctrine of separability allows arbitration agreements to survive the invalidity of the underlying contract.
* An arbitration agreement is not subject to stamp duty under the Maharashtra Stamp Act, 1958.
* Non-payment of stamp duty is a curable defect, and it does not render the arbitration agreement unenforceable.
* Generally, civil fraud is arbitrable, but serious fraud or fraud that impacts the validity of the arbitration clause itself are not.
* A Writ Petition challenging an order refusing to refer parties to arbitration is not maintainable when a statutory remedy is available.
