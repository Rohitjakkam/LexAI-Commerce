## 2. Background and Context

* **Brief Overview:** The Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) sought to set aside an arbitral award in favor of Jain Infra Projects Limited (JIPL).

This delay led to the case.
* **Key Issues:** 
    * Whether the Calcutta High Court had territorial and pecuniary jurisdiction to hear the case.
    * Whether the KMC's delay in filing the application to set aside the award could be condoned.
    * Whether the time spent by the KMC pursuing the matter in lower courts without jurisdiction (due to a jurisdictional error) should be excluded under Section 14 of the Limitation Act, 1963.

## 4. Arguments Presented

* **KMC's Argument:**
    * The 22-day delay in filing the application was caused by sufficient reason and should be condoned under Section 34(3) of the Act.
    * The time spent between 18 June 2019 and 22 December 2020, while the case was in courts without jurisdiction, should be excluded under Section 14 of the Limitation Act, 1963.
    * The application filed before the Calcutta High Court was a re-filing, not a fresh filing, and thus the delay in re-filing was not substantial.
    * The KMC was not at fault for the delay in receiving the cause papers after the order of return was passed by the Commercial Court at Alipore.
    * The KMC is entitled to the benefits of the extensions to limitation periods granted by the Supreme Court due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
* **JIPL's Argument:**
    * The KMC's application was filed beyond the permissible 120-day limit, as Section 14 of the Limitation Act is not applicable to Section 34 of the Act.
    * The KMC was responsible for the delay in receiving the cause papers and did not act diligently.
    * The KMC should have filed an appeal against the order returning the application, rather than re-filing it. 
    * The KMC's re-filing was a fresh filing, and the delay in re-filing should not be condoned.
    * The Supreme Court orders regarding limitation period extensions due to the pandemic were not applicable because the limitation period in this case had begun before 15 March 2020.
    * The KMC failed to file an application under Order 7 Rule 10A(3) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, which would have been necessary to invoke the benefits of Section 14 of the Limitation Act.

## 5. Courtâ€™s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The Calcutta High Court had both territorial and pecuniary jurisdiction to hear the case.
    * The KMC was entitled to the benefits of Section 14 of the Limitation Act, 1963, as they had pursued the case bona fide in courts without jurisdiction.
    * The time between 18 June 2019 and 22 December 2020 should be excluded from the calculation of the limitation period.
    * The 22-day delay in filing the initial application should be condoned.
    * The re-filing before the Calcutta High Court was not considered a fresh filing, but a continuation of the original proceeding.
    * The court did not rely on the Supreme Court orders regarding pandemic-related limitation period extensions.
* **Interpretation of Law:** 
    * The court interpreted Section 34(3) of the Act as having its own provision for condoning delay, separate from Section 5 of the Limitation Act.
    * The court held that Section 14 of the Limitation Act was applicable to arbitration proceedings, including applications under Section 34.
    * The court determined that the time spent in courts without jurisdiction was excludable under Section 14, provided the party acted in good faith. 
    * The court interpreted Order 7 Rule 10A(2) as not being mandatory, so the failure to file an application under this rule was not a fatal flaw. 
* **Application of Law:** 
    * The court applied the principles of jurisdiction, limitation, condonation of delay, and exclusion of time to the specific facts of the case.
    * The court relied on precedents, particularly those regarding the application of Section 14 of the Limitation Act in arbitration cases and the concept of re-filing versus fresh filing.

## 6. Judgment

* **Final Decision:** The Calcutta High Court allowed the KMC's appeal and set aside the order of the single judge dismissing the application.
* **Relief Granted:** The KMC's application to set aside the arbitral award was allowed, and the case was sent back to the lower court to be heard on merits.
* **Orders:** The court ordered that the application be heard on its merits and that the time spent by the KMC in lower courts without jurisdiction be excluded from the limitation period.

## 7. Implications
