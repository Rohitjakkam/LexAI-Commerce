## 1. Case Title

* **Case Name:** H S Sahni vs Mukul Singhal & Anr
* **Court:** Delhi High Court
* **Date of Judgment:** 10th November 2022
* **Citation:** 2022/DHC/004764

## 2. Background and Context

* **Brief Overview:** The case involves a trademark and copyright dispute between two companies: M/s M.G. Cables (India) (Appellants) and M/s M.K. Auto Sales Corporation (H.S. Sahni). Both companies manufacture and sell automotive components, including control cables, under similar trademarks. The Appellants claim to be prior users of the trademark "M.G. Cable" and have registered it under Class 6 (common metals and their alloys), while H.S. Sahni claims to be a prior user of "M.G" and "M.G.I" and has registered them under Class 12 (vehicles).
* **Key Issues:** 
    * Whether the Appellants or H.S. Sahni were the prior users of the trademarks in question.
    * Whether the Appellants' registration of the trademark "M.G. Cable" under Class 6 protects their rights in relation to control cables, which fall under Class 12.
    * Whether H.S. Sahni's registration of "M.G" and "M.G.I" under Class 12 entitles him to use the trademarks despite the Appellants' prior usage.

    * The Trade Marks Act, 1999: 
        * Section 7: Classification of goods and services.

    * Sri Vari Pharma v. Apex Labrotories Pvt Ltd und Ors.: 2015 SCC OnLine Mad 14278: Trademark classification is broad, and the specific product's inclusion in a class is a matter for trial.

* **Legal Doctrines:**
    * Prior Use: The principle that prior use of a trademark establishes stronger rights than mere registration.
    * Acquiescence: A legal doctrine that bars a party from asserting a claim if they knowingly allowed another party to use the mark without objection.

## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Appellants' Argument:** 
    * They were the prior users of the trademark "M.G. Cable" since 1996, evidenced by various documents including invoices, licenses, and phone bills.
    * They have registered the artistic work of the label "M.G. Cable" and have acquired considerable goodwill and reputation in the market.
    * H.S. Sahni has not established prior use of the trademarks "M.G" and "M.G.I" and has only produced invoices from 2017 onwards.
    * The Appellants' registration of "M.G. Cable" under Class 6 covers control cables, as "non-electrical wires" can be interpreted broadly to include control cables.
    * H.S. Sahni's use of the mark "M.G" and "M.G.I" is likely to cause confusion and mislead customers.
* **H.S. Sahni's Argument:** 
    * He is the prior user of the trademarks "M.G" and "M.G.I" since 1989 and has registered them under Class 12.
    * The Appellants' registration under Class 6 does not protect their rights in relation to control cables, which are specifically covered under Class 12.
    * The Appellants are aware of his trademarks and have acquiesced to their use, as evidenced by their opposition to a trademark application under Class 12 for "MGX."
    * The marks "M.G" and "M.G.I" are distinct from "M.G. Cable" and do not infringe on the Appellants' trademark rights.

## 5. Court's Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:** 
    * The Court finds that the Appellants have established prima facie prior use of the trademark "M.G. Cable" since 1996, while H.S. Sahni has failed to provide sufficient evidence of prior use of "M.G" and "M.G.I" before 2017.
    * The Court holds that the Appellants' registration of "M.G. Cable" under Class 6, covering "non-electrical wires," can be interpreted broadly enough to include control cables, which fall under Class 12.
    * The Court finds no evidence of acquiescence on the part of the Appellants regarding H.S. Sahni's use of "M.G" and "M.G.I," as H.S. Sahni has not demonstrated prior use before 2017.
* **Interpretation of Law:** 
    * The Court emphasizes that prior use rights are superior to registration rights under the Trade Marks Act.
    * The Court interprets the classification of goods broadly, acknowledging that a registration under one class can potentially protect a broader range of products.
    * The Court emphasizes that acquiescence requires more than just inaction and requires a clear demonstration of the plaintiff's conduct encouraging the use of the allegedly infringing mark.
* **Application of Law:** 
    * The Court applies the principle of prior user rights, granting protection to the Appellants as the prior users of the mark "M.G. Cable."
    * The Court applies the broad interpretation of goods classification, finding that the Appellants' registration covers control cables despite being registered under Class 6.
    * The Court rejects the argument of acquiescence, finding no evidence that the Appellants knowingly allowed H.S. Sahni's use of "M.G" and "M.G.I" without objection.

## 6. Judgment

* **Final Decision:** The Delhi High Court allowed the Appellants' appeal [FAO (COMM) 89/2021] and rejected the appeal filed by H.S. Sahni [FAO (COMM) 88/2021].
* **Relief Granted:** The Court granted an interim injunction restraining H.S. Sahni from using the trademarks "M.G" and "M.G.I" or any other marks deceptively similar to "M.G. Cable" until the disposal of the rectification application filed by the Appellants. 
* **Orders:**
    * H.S. Sahni is restrained from using "M.G," "M.G.I," and any deceptively similar marks.
    * The suit is stayed until the disposal of the rectification application filed by the Appellants.

## 7. Implications

* **Impact on Law:** The judgment reaffirms the importance of prior user rights in trademark disputes and clarifies that registration under a particular class can extend to a broader range of goods.
* **Future Relevance:** This case provides guidance for future cases involving overlapping goods classifications and the importance of demonstrating prior use in trademark disputes.
* **Broader Context:** The case highlights the importance of protecting trademarks and copyrights to maintain fair competition and prevent consumer confusion. 

## 8. Summary Points
