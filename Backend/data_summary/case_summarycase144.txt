## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Plaintiff’s Argument:**
    * The plaintiffs in the various appeals argued that the appellability provisions of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, did not restrict their rights to appeal under the Letters Patent or the Code. They contended that the Act only clarified certain appellable orders and did not exclude any other appellable orders traditionally entertained by the Madras High Court. 
    * They argued that the phrase "judgment or order" in Section 13 of the Act encompassed both decrees and orders, and the proviso to the section only specified certain additional appellable orders.
    * They argued that the Act did not apply retrospectively to suits filed before the Commercial Division was established.
    * They contested the orders returning their plaints, arguing that the Madras High Court had jurisdiction based on the location of their registered office, the sale of goods within the jurisdiction, or the principle of forum non conveniens.
    * They argued that the orders modifying or refusing to vacate injunctions were not justified.
    * They argued that the orders revoking leave to institute suits under Clause 12 of the Letters Patent were flawed because:
        * The Madras High Court had jurisdiction as a part of the cause of action arose within its jurisdiction.
        * The suits were well-founded on the statutory tort recognized in Section 35 of the Companies Act, 2013.
        * The defendants were jointly and severally liable for their actions.
        * The insolvency proceedings against DHFL did not preclude the plaintiff from suing the other defendants under Section 35.
        * The Madras High Court was the appropriate forum as the plaintiff's registered office was located there, and witnesses and documents might be readily available.
* **Defendant’s Argument:**
    * The defendants in the various appeals argued that the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, curtailed the scope of appellability in the Madras High Court, and only those orders specified in Section 13 or Order XLIII of the Code were appellable.
    * They argued that the phrase "judgment or order" in Section 13 excluded orders traditionally considered appellable under the Letters Patent, and the proviso to the section was restrictive.
    * They argued that the Act applied retrospectively to all suits filed after the Act came into effect, even if the Commercial Division was established later.
    * They argued that the Madras High Court lacked jurisdiction based on the principle of forum non conveniens.
    * They argued that the orders returning plaints were justified as the entirety of the cause of action arose in Mumbai.
    * They argued that the orders modifying or refusing to vacate injunctions were justified as the plaintiffs had failed to establish a strong case for injunction.
    * They argued that the orders revoking leave to institute suits under Clause 12 of the Letters Patent were justified because:
        * The Madras High Court lacked jurisdiction because the entirety of the cause of action arose in Mumbai.
        * The plaintiff had failed to demonstrate a proper cause of action under Section 35 of the Companies Act, 2013.
        * The insolvency proceedings against DHFL rendered it impossible to sue the company and the other defendants jointly and severally.
        * The plaintiff's choice of forum was not justified considering the overwhelming inconvenience of having witnesses and documents in Mumbai.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The court found that the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, significantly curtailed the scope of appellability in the Madras High Court.
    * The court held that the phrase "judgment or order" in Section 13 of the Act did not encompass all orders traditionally considered appellable under the Letters Patent and only included those orders specified in the section or Order XLIII of the Code.
    * The court interpreted the proviso to Section 13 as restrictive and found that no appeal would lie against any order other than those specified in Order XLIII of the Code and those provided for in Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.
    * The court held that the Commercial Courts Act applied retrospectively to all suits filed after the Act came into effect, regardless of when the Commercial Division was established.
    * The court held that the principle of forum non conveniens could be applied by the Madras High Court to return plaints even though Order VII Rule 10 of the Code did not apply to Chartered High Courts.
    * The court concluded that the Madras High Court lacked jurisdiction in the suits for damages arising from the DHFL debenture issue as the entirety of the cause of action arose in Mumbai.
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The court interpreted Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, as restricting the scope of appellability to only those orders specifically enumerated in Order XLIII of the Code and Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.
    * The court interpreted the phrase "judgment or order" in Section 13 to exclude orders traditionally considered appellable under the Letters Patent.
    * The court interpreted the proviso to Section 13 as restrictive and not merely clarificatory.
    * The court interpreted the "otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of this Act" clause in Section 13(2) as eliminating the applicability of the Letters Patent in respect of appellability.
    * The court interpreted Section 14 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, as preventing the plaintiff from suing DHFL, the corporate debtor, in the present suit.
    * The court interpreted Section 35 of the Companies Act, 2013, as imposing joint and several liability on the defendants, even though DHFL was not a party to the suit.
    * The court considered several precedents on the principles of forum non conveniens, appellability under the Letters Patent, and the jurisdiction of Chartered High Courts.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The court applied the interpretation of Section 13 to dismiss all appeals challenging orders that were not specifically provided for in Order XLIII of the Code or Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.
    * The court applied the principle of forum non conveniens to return the plaints in the suits for damages arising from the DHFL debenture issue, finding that Mumbai was the more appropriate forum.
    * The court applied Section 14 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, to hold that DHFL could not be sued in the present suit because of the moratorium.
    * The court applied Section 35 of the Companies Act, 2013, to find that the defendants were jointly and severally liable even though DHFL was not a party.

## 6. Judgment

* **Final Decision:** 
    *  The appeals challenging orders dismissing applications for rejection of plaints, granting or modifying injunctions, and revoking leave to institute suits under Clause 12 of the Letters Patent were dismissed as not maintainable.
    * The appeals challenging orders returning the plaints were dismissed except for the appeals arising from the suit for damages arising from the DHFL debenture issue.
    * The appeals challenging orders modifying or refusing to vacate injunctions were dismissed, but the injunction was modified to last for six weeks or until an earlier order by the receiving court.
    * The appeals challenging orders revoking leave to institute suits under Clause 12 of the Letters Patent in the DHFL debenture issue case were allowed, and the orders were set aside.
* **Relief Granted:** The court allowed the appeals challenging the orders revoking leave to institute suits in the DHFL debenture issue case, allowing the plaintiff to proceed with the suit in the Madras High Court.
* **Orders:**
    * The court dismissed the appeals deemed not maintainable.
    * The court modified the injunction in the trademark infringement case to last for six weeks.
    * The court set aside the orders revoking leave to institute suits in the DHFL debenture issue case.

## 7. Implications

* **Impact on Law:** The judgment clarifies the scope of appellability under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, and restricts the right of appeal in the Madras High Court to those orders specifically enumerated in the Act or Order XLIII of the Code. This decision may influence similar interpretations of the Act in other High Courts.
* **Future Relevance:** The judgment will likely be a key precedent for determining the appellability of orders in the Madras High Court's Commercial Division and for interpreting the scope of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015.
* **Broader Context:** The judgment emphasizes the purpose of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, to expedite the resolution of commercial disputes and reduce procedural delays. It highlights the importance of striking a balance between providing access to justice and ensuring efficient case management in the commercial courts.
