## 4. Arguments Presented

•	**Plaintiff’s Argument (SBPDCL):**
    * BEDCPL is only an agent of SPML and has no right to initiate arbitration proceedings.
    * There is no arbitration agreement between SBPDCL and BEDCPL; the agreement is between SBPDCL and SPML.
    * The Arbitral Tribunal’s mandate expired on 13th May 2017, and the subsequent extension was invalid.
    * The District Judge had no jurisdiction to extend the Tribunal’s mandate.
    * SBPDCL was justified in initiating fresh arbitration proceedings against SPML.
    * SPML should be made a party to the arbitration proceedings.
    * The earlier arbitration proceedings are null and void.

•	**Defendant’s Argument (SPML and BEDCPL):**
    * BEDCPL is a separate legal entity and is the rightful party to the arbitration agreement.
    * SPML is not a party to the arbitration agreement.
    * The court had the jurisdiction to extend the mandate of the Arbitral Tribunal.
    * SBPDCL waived their right to object to the arbitration proceedings by participating in them.
    * SBPDCL cannot initiate fresh arbitration proceedings as the earlier proceedings are valid and ongoing.
    * The District Judge correctly extended the mandate of the Tribunal.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

•	**Key Findings:**
    * SPML, despite being the confirming party in the DFA, is a party to the arbitration agreement due to its undertaking to discharge all of BEDCPL’s liabilities.
    * The Principal Civil Court (District Judge) does not have the jurisdiction to extend the mandate of the Arbitral Tribunal after it has expired; this power rests with the court that appointed the Arbitrators.
    * The original Arbitral Tribunal, constituted in 2016, ceased to exist after its mandate expired in 2017.
    * SBPDCL’s initiation of fresh arbitration proceedings against SPML is justified as the earlier proceedings were invalid.

•	**Interpretation of Law:**
    * The court interpreted the relevant provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, to determine the jurisdiction of the courts and the parties’ rights.
    * The court referred to various precedents to clarify the scope of agent’s right to sue, waiver, jurisdiction, and conflict of jurisdiction.
    * The court interpreted the terms “extend” and “Court” in Section 29A of the Act to determine the scope of the court’s power.

•	**Application of Law:**
    * The court applied the principle of agent’s right to sue to determine that SPML is a party to the arbitration agreement, despite BEDCPL being the signatory.
    * The court applied the principle of jurisdiction to determine that the District Judge had no power to extend the Arbitral Tribunal’s mandate.
    * The court applied the principle of waiver to reject SPML’s claim that SBPDCL waived their right to object to the arbitration proceedings.
