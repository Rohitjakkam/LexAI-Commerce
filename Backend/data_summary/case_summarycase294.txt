## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Plaintiff’s Argument (Claimants):**
    * The Respondent's determination of the effective dates was erroneous and contrary to the terms of the agreements.
    * The Respondent's revision of rates was illegal and unsustainable.
    * The transaction slabs should have been proportionately increased with the increase in the number of centers.
    * The Arbitrator's award should be affirmed in its entirety.
    * The Arbitrator was correct in awarding interest at 12% per annum.
    * The Commercial Court was not within its powers to modify the Arbitrator's award.
* **Defendant’s Argument (Mee Seva):**
    * The determination of effective dates was in accordance with the agreements.
    * The revision of rates was permissible under the contracts.
    * The transaction slabs were not required to be increased.
    * The Arbitrator erred in awarding 5/- per transaction for electricity bills and in extending the contract period.
    * The Arbitrator exceeded his jurisdiction by passing two awards (preliminary and final).
    * The Commercial Court should have remanded the matter to the Arbitrator for a fresh award.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The court found that the Arbitrator's decision to pass a preliminary award and a final award was not permissible under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.
    * The court held that the Commercial Court was without jurisdiction to modify the Arbitrator's award in a Section 34 application.
    * The court further found that the Arbitrator exceeded his jurisdiction by passing a final award after a Section 34 application was filed challenging the preliminary award.
* **Interpretation of Law:** The court closely examined the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, and relevant case law. The court emphasized the limited grounds for setting aside an arbitral award under Section 34 and the absence of any power to modify an award.
* **Application of Law:** The court applied these legal principles to the facts of the case, concluding that the Arbitrator's approach was contrary to the statutory scheme and that the Commercial Court erred in modifying the award.

## 6. Judgment

* **Final Decision:** The High Court allowed the appeals filed by the Claimants and the Mee Seva organization.
* **Relief Granted:**  The court set aside both the Arbitrator's award and the Commercial Court's decision modifying the award. 
* **Orders:** The matter was remitted back to arbitration, with Sri Justice Vilas V. Afzulpurkar, Retired Judge of the High Court, appointed as the sole Arbitrator. The parties were instructed to submit all relevant documents to the new Arbitrator within four weeks. The new Arbitrator was requested to conclude the proceedings expeditiously within 16 weeks from the date of submission of documents.

## 7. Implications

* **Impact on Law:** The judgment reiterates the importance of the limited scope of judicial review of arbitral awards under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. It highlights the absence of power to modify awards and the need to adhere to the statutory framework for arbitration proceedings.
* **Future Relevance:** This case serves as a reminder for parties and courts involved in arbitration proceedings to strictly adhere to the statutory provisions governing the process, particularly with regard to the passing of awards and the limitations of judicial review.
* **Broader Context:** The judgment highlights the complexities of dispute resolution involving government initiatives and contractual agreements with private entities. It emphasizes the need for clarity and consistency in contract terms and the importance of proper procedural adherence in arbitration proceedings.

## 8. Summary Points

* The Arbitrator's decision to pass separate preliminary and final awards was deemed invalid.
* The Commercial Court lacked the jurisdiction to modify the Arbitrator's award.
* The court emphasized the limited scope of judicial review in Section 34 applications.
* The case was remitted back to arbitration for a fresh determination.
