## Arguments Presented

• **Appellant's (Dish TV) Argument:**
    - The suit was initially an ordinary civil suit, only becoming a 'commercial suit' after the impugned order. Therefore, the appeal is maintainable under the Delhi High Court Act, 1966.
    - Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act doesn't apply as the order was passed before the suit was converted into a commercial suit.
    - The impugned order affects Dish TV's right to defend the case, making it a 'judgment' under the Supreme Court precedent of Shah Babulal Khimji.
    - The time limit of 120 days for filing a written statement under the Commercial Courts Act shouldn't apply as the suit wasn't transferred to a commercial court within that timeframe. 
    - Proviso to Section 15(4) of the Commercial Courts Act, which allows the court to prescribe new time limits for filing a written statement in transferred suits, gives discretion to the court.
    - The 120-day limit under Order V Rule 1(1) of the CPC is directory, not mandatory, especially in cases of pending suits.
• **Respondent's (Gulf DTH) Argument:**
    - The dispute is a 'commercial dispute' under the Commercial Courts Act, making the appeal subject to Section 13, which restricts appeals from Commercial Division orders.
    - Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act overrides the Delhi High Court Act.
    - The impugned order doesn't affect any valuable right of Dish TV and doesn't finally decide the dispute. 
    - The legislature intended the Commercial Courts Act to apply to pending suits after transfer to the Commercial Division.
    - The Single Judge exercised its discretion under Section 15(4) of the Commercial Courts Act by not extending the time limit for Dish TV to file a written statement.

## Court's Analysis and Reasoning

• **Key Findings:**
    - The court recognized the dispute as a 'commercial dispute' under Section 2(c) of the Commercial Courts Act.
    - The suit was filed as an ordinary civil suit and only became a commercial suit after the impugned order was passed. 
    - The court emphasized that the provisions of the Commercial Courts Act, including the 120-day time limit for written statements, only applied after a pending suit was transferred to the Commercial Division.
    - The impugned order closing the right to file a written statement was considered a 'judgment' under the Shah Babulal Khimji case as it affected a valuable right of the appellant to defend the suit.
• **Interpretation of Law:**
    - The court interpreted Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act as only applying to appeals from orders passed after a suit is converted to a commercial suit.
    - The court applied the principle of discretion outlined in the Reliance General Insurance case, holding that the court could prescribe new time limits for filing written statements in transferred suits.
    - The court interpreted the provisions of the Commercial Courts Act as not retroactively applying to suits filed before the constitution of the Commercial Division.
• **Application of Law:**
    - The court ruled that the appeal was maintainable under Section 10(1) of the Delhi High Court Act, 1966, as the impugned order was passed before the suit was converted to a commercial suit.
    - The court applied the ratio of the Raj Process Equipments case, concluding that the 120-day time limit for filing a written statement did not apply because the suit was not transferred to a commercial court within that timeframe.
    - The court determined that the Single Judge should have exercised its discretion under Section 15(4) of the Commercial Courts Act to prescribe a new time limit for filing a written statement after the suit was renumbered as a commercial suit.

## Judgment

• **Final Decision:** The appeal was allowed.
• **Relief Granted:** The impugned order was set aside. Dish TV was allowed to file its written statement, and the suit was to proceed from that stage.
• **Orders:** The court directed the Registry to take the written statement filed by Dish TV on record.

## Implications

• **Impact on Law:**
    - The judgment clarifies the application of the Commercial Courts Act in cases where suits are filed as ordinary civil suits but subsequently converted to commercial suits. 
    - It emphasizes the discretionary power of courts to prescribe new time limits for filing written statements in transferred suits under Section 15(4) of the Commercial Courts Act.
• **Future Relevance:**
    - The judgment sets a precedent for future cases involving similar situations where suits are pending before the constitution of the Commercial Division.
    - It underscores the need for clarity in determining the applicability of the Commercial Courts Act to pending suits based on their conversion to commercial suits.
• **Broader Context:**
    - The case highlights the ongoing process of adapting to the Commercial Courts Act and its impact on civil litigation practices.
    - It reflects the importance of ensuring fairness and procedural justice for all parties in commercial disputes.

## Summary Points
