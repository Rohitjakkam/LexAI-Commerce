## Arguments Presented

* **Appellant’s Argument:**
    * The limitation period for filing a Section 34 application starts from the date of receipt of the award, not the day following the receipt.
    * The combined effect of the "three months" and "thirty days" provisions in Section 34(3) and its proviso is a total period of 120 days.
    * The Commercial Court, West Tripura, lacked territorial jurisdiction as the subject matter of the dispute was located in Dhalai District.
    * The Court of Additional District Judge, West Tripura, was incompetent to hear the Commercial Appeal.
    * The explanations offered by the respondent for condoning the delay were insufficient.
* **Respondent’s Argument:**
    * The appellant entered appearance before the Commercial Court but did not file written objections to the condonation petition.
    * The court had territorial jurisdiction based on the appellant's residence in Agartala and the issuance of the award in Agartala.
    * The appellant's filing of execution applications against the same awards demonstrated a dual stand.
    * The delay of 30 days was condonable as it was explained in the condonation application.
    * The "three months" period under Section 34(3) is not 90 days, but an actual calendar month.
    * The "thirty days" period for condonation of delay is a distinct period.
    * The General Clauses Act and Limitation Act provisions are applicable for calculating the limitation period.
    * The court's jurisdiction as a Commercial Court was established through government notification and had not been challenged before.

## Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The court found that the appellant received the arbitral award on the same date in both cases (25th July 2022).
    * The application under Section 34 was filed on 24th November 2022, with a condonation application seeking condonation of a 30-day delay.
    * The court relied on the precedents set by the Supreme Court, particularly the decisions in Union of India vs. Tecco Trichy Engineers & Contractors, State of Maharashtra vs. ARK Builders Pvt. Ltd., P Radha Bai vs. P Ashok Kumar, and Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam vs. Navigant Technologies, to determine that the limitation period under Section 34(3) starts from the date of receipt of the award.
    * The court found that the language of Section 34(3) specifically refers to the date of receipt of the award, making other interpretations, such as the application of Section 12(1) of the Limitation Act, inappropriate.
    * The court further observed that the proviso to Section 34(3) refers to "thirty days" separately, implying that the period of "three months" is not equivalent to 90 days but rather three actual calendar months.
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The court interpreted Section 34(3) of the Act to mean that the limitation period for filing a Section 34 application is "three months" from the date of receipt of the award, which is to be understood as three calendar months.
    * The court found that the specific language of Section 34(3) excluded the application of provisions such as Section 12(1) of the Limitation Act and Section 9 of the General Clauses Act.
    * The court distinguished the decision in Himachal Techno Engineers from the later pronouncements by the Supreme Court.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The court applied the principles derived from the Supreme Court decisions to determine the commencement date of the limitation period.
    * The court calculated the limitation period based on the date of receipt of the award (25th July 2022) and determined that the three-month period expired on 24th October 2022.
    * The court concluded that the application filed on 24th November 2022 was beyond the limitation period and therefore barred by time, even after considering the 30-day extension period.

## Judgment

* **Final Decision:** The appeals were allowed.
* **Relief Granted:** The court set aside the impugned orders of the Commercial Court, West Tripura, which condoned the delay in filing the Section 34 applications.
* **Orders:** The court held that the Section 34 applications were barred by limitation and dismissed the matters pending before the Commercial Court, West Tripura, being CM (ARB) 06/2022 and CM (ARB) 07/2022.

## Implications

* **Impact on Law:** The judgment reinforces the importance of strictly adhering to the limitation periods prescribed under Section 34(3) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.
* **Future Relevance:** The judgment is likely to be cited as precedent in future cases concerning the computation of limitation periods under Section 34(3) and the applicability of other relevant provisions.
* **Broader Context:** The decision highlights the significance of clear and consistent interpretations of legal provisions, particularly in the context of time-bound proceedings such as those governed by the Arbitration and Conciliation Act.

## Summary Points

* The limitation period under Section 34(3) of the Act starts on the date of receipt of the arbitral award, not the day following the receipt.
* The "three months" period under Section 34(3) is to be understood as three actual calendar months.
* The provisions of the Limitation Act and General Clauses Act are not applicable for calculating the limitation period under Section 34(3).
* The court cannot condone delays beyond the prescribed time limits under Section 34(3).
