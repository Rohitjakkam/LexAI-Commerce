## 1. Case Title

* **Case Name:** M/S. Hussain Sheth Ispat vs. Capital Corp Asia Private Limited
* **Court:** Gujarat High Court
* **Date of Judgment:** 16th June, 2023
* **Citation:** C/SCA/5483/2023 

## 2. Background and Context

* **Brief Overview:** This case involved a dispute between M/S. Hussain Sheth Ispat (the plaintiff) and Capital Corp Asia Private Limited (the defendant) over the sale of a ship named MV - SENIHA-S. The plaintiffs, a shipbreaking and steel manufacturing firm, entered into a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with the defendants for the purchase of the vessel. However, the delivery of the vessel was repeatedly delayed due to various reasons, including the vessel's arrest by the Indonesian Court. Eventually, both parties agreed to cancel the MOA, but the defendant's bank, DBS Bank Limited (defendant No. 3), had already discounted a Letter of Credit issued by Canara Bank (defendant No. 2) in favor of the defendant. The plaintiffs sued the defendants, seeking a declaration, permanent injunction, and other reliefs. 
* **Key Issues:**
    * Whether the Letter of Credit issued by Canara Bank was independent of the MOA between the plaintiff and defendant.
    * Whether the discounting of the Letter of Credit by DBS Bank was in accordance with the terms of the Letter of Credit and UCP 600.
    * Whether the plaintiffs were entitled to an injunction restraining Canara Bank from making payment under the Letter of Credit.

## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Plaintiff’s Argument:**
    * The Letter of Credit was not independent of the MOA because it was subject to the fulfillment of the terms and conditions of the MOA, including the physical delivery of the vessel.
    * The defendants committed fraud by presenting documents for discounting the Letter of Credit without the actual delivery of the vessel.
    * DBS Bank (defendant No. 3) was duty-bound to determine whether the conditions of the Letter of Credit were fulfilled before discounting it, and it failed to exercise due care. 
    * The plaintiffs had not waived any terms and conditions of the Letter of Credit, and their acceptance of the documents was conditional upon the arrival of the vessel.
    * The plaintiffs faced irretrievable prejudice because they had not received the vessel but were still obligated to pay the sale consideration. 
* **Defendant’s Arguments:**
    * **Defendant No. 2 (Canara Bank):** The Letter of Credit was an independent contract, and the terms of the MOA did not apply. The plaintiffs had authorized Canara Bank to issue the SWIFT Message, which triggered the discounting of the Letter of Credit.
    * **Defendant No. 3 (DBS Bank):** The plaintiffs did not seek any relief against DBS Bank. DBS Bank acted in accordance with the terms of the Letter of Credit, and the discounting was triggered by the plaintiffs' acceptance of the documents. They did not have knowledge of any fraud. 

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The court found that the plaintiffs had failed to allege fraud against DBS Bank (defendant No. 3) in their pleadings.
    * The plaintiffs had accepted the documents presented by the defendant No. 1 for discounting the Letter of Credit, signifying their agreement to the presentation.
    * The court concluded that the Letter of Credit was an independent contract between the issuing bank (Canara Bank) and the negotiating bank (DBS Bank).
    * The court found that the terms of the Letter of Credit had been amended to remove the requirement of the vessel's physical arrival at Alang as a condition for discounting.
    * The court held that the plaintiffs had not raised any dispute regarding the sufficiency of the documents presented for discounting the Letter of Credit. 
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The court applied the well-established legal principle that Letter of Credits are generally independent contracts between banks and not subject to the terms of the underlying sales contracts.
    * The court interpreted UCP 600 to hold that the issuing bank (Canara Bank) was obligated to honor the Letter of Credit if the documents presented by the beneficiary were compliant, even if the goods were not delivered.
    * The court emphasized the need for clear evidence of fraud in cases involving injunctions against the invocation of Letter of Credits.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The court applied the legal principles to the facts of the case and concluded that the plaintiffs had not established a case for judicial interference in the Letter of Credit transaction.
    * The court found that the plaintiffs had not met the burden of proving fraud on the part of DBS Bank.
    * The court held that the ex parte injunction granted by the Commercial Court was wrong as it was granted without sufficient grounds and in ignorance of established legal principles.
