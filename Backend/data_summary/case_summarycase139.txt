## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Plaintiff's Argument (ONGC):**
    * The award was barred by limitation as the claims regarding NPDs for the first four quarters were made more than three years after the payments were made.
    * The award was based on patent illegalities and inconsistencies in the findings of the arbitrator. 
    * The award was against the public policy of India because it upheld the refund of TDS on WCT despite Planetcast's failure to comply with relevant State VAT Acts and Rules.
    * The arbitrator erred in holding that Clause 7.4 of the contract applied to the issue of NPDs and that ONGC had not followed the procedure for deducting NPDs. 
    * The arbitrator erred in finding that Planetcast had provided suitable replacement equipment and that ONGC had deducted NPDs without giving Planetcast notice. 
    * The award granted a refund of service tax on the basis of arguments and evidence not presented in the pleadings.
* **Defendant's Argument (Planetcast):**
    * The claim was not barred by limitation as the parties continued to have a jural relationship regarding the contract.
    * The arbitrator's findings regarding the NPD deductions were well-reasoned and based on a proper assessment of the evidence. 
    * The contract did not require Planetcast to be registered under the VAT Act, and therefore, ONGC's deduction of TDS on WCT was illegal.
    * ONGC was obligated to indemnify Planetcast for any increase in taxes, including service tax. 
    * The arbitrator's findings regarding the suitability of the equipment and the lack of notice regarding NPD deductions were based on a proper interpretation of the evidence and the contract.
