    * The City Civil Court lacks jurisdiction as it is not a "principal Civil Court" in the district.

    * The arbitration clause in the agreement allows the petitioner to decide the venue of arbitration, including shifting it from Chennai.
* **Defendant’s Argument:**
    * The City Civil Court has concurrent jurisdiction over commercial disputes between Rs. 10 lakhs and Rs. 1 crore under the Notification published in the Kolkata Gazette Extraordinary on 20.3.2020.
    * The application is barred under Section 42 of the 1996 Act and Order XXIII Rule 1 of the CPC as it was previously filed before the City Civil Court.
    * The Loan Agreement specifies Chennai as the venue of arbitration, and the Calcutta High Court is not the proper court.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The court acknowledged the notification granting concurrent jurisdiction to the City Civil Court and the Commercial Division of the Calcutta High Court for commercial disputes between Rs. 10 lakhs and Rs. 1 crore.
    * The court found that the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 introduced a pecuniary platform for commercial disputes including arbitrations, and the Notification of 20.3.2020 reorganized the hierarchy of Commercial Courts based on pecuniary limits.
    * The court rejected the petitioner's argument that Section 2(1)(e)(i) of the 1996 Act excludes the City Civil Court from jurisdiction, concluding that it creates no conflict with the 2015 Act or the notification.
    * The court found the petitioner's attempt to withdraw the application from the City Civil Court and file it afresh in the Calcutta High Court contrary to the principle of Section 42 of the 1996 Act and Order XXIII Rule 1 of the CPC.
    * The court interpreted the arbitration clause to designate Chennai as the venue, rejecting the petitioner's claim of having sole discretion to change the venue.
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The court interpreted the "Court" definition in Section 2(1)(e)(i) of the 1996 Act as inclusive, allowing both the Calcutta High Court and the City Civil Court to exercise jurisdiction based on pecuniary limits.
    * The court interpreted the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 as establishing a hierarchy of Commercial Courts based on pecuniary jurisdiction.
    * The court interpreted the arbitration clause as giving Chennai the primary venue, rejecting the petitioner's claim of having absolute authority to change it.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The court applied the principles of jurisdiction, res judicata, and forum conveniens to conclude that the Calcutta High Court did not have jurisdiction to hear the application.
    * The court applied Section 42 of the 1996 Act and Order XXIII Rule 1 of the CPC to find the application barred by the petitioner's prior attempt to withdraw the application from the City Civil Court.
    * The court applied the forum conveniens principle based on the admitted facts of the case, including the agreement being made in Chennai, the agreement being terminated in Chennai, and the petitioner's registered office being in Chennai.
