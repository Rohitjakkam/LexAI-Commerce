## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Appellant’s Argument:** The appellants argued that:
    * The order granting leave to file a suit under Clause 12 of the Letters Patent and the subsequent order refusing to revoke this leave were not passed under the Commercial Courts Act 2015. 
    *  Therefore, the appeals filed against these orders were not barred by the provisions of Section 13 of the Act.
    * They argued that the Commercial Division’s jurisdiction only kicks in after the suit is numbered and registered as a commercial cause, not at the earlier stage of granting leave.
    * They relied on the distinction between the original side of the High Court and the Commercial Division, asserting that the leave application was dealt with by the Judge on the Original Side and not under the Commercial Courts Act.
* **Respondent’s Argument:** The Respondent (Pradeep Stainless India Pvt. Ltd.) argued that:
    * The stage at which the orders were passed was irrelevant.
    * The subject matter of the suit, being a commercial dispute as defined by the Commercial Courts Act 2015, determined the jurisdiction of the Commercial Division.
    * The objective of the Commercial Courts Act was to expedite commercial disputes, and interpretations should align with this purpose.
    * The respondent relied on the judgment in Owners and Parties Interested in the Vessel M.V.Polaris Galaxy v. Banque Cantonale De Geneve, which emphasized the need to interpret the Act harmoniously to prevent unnecessary appeals from inconsequential orders.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**

    * The court emphasized the Act's purpose of expediting commercial litigation and minimizing unnecessary appeals.
