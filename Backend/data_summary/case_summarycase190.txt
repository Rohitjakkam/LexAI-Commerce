## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Appellant’s Argument:**
    * The Respondent's application for amendment of the claim was belated and beyond the scope of the reference to arbitration.
    * The Appellant had legitimate grounds to terminate the CISP agreement based on the Respondent's Director's involvement in corrupt acts, as evidenced by the First Information Reports and the Respondent's own admission.
    * The Respondent did not prove the actual damages claimed, and the arbitral tribunal erred in awarding nominal damages based on mere assumptions and projections.
    * The arbitral tribunal erred in awarding costs of arbitration without sufficient evidence.
* **Respondent’s Argument:**
    * The amendment to the claim was not belated and was within the scope of the reference to arbitration, as it merely quantified existing claims. 
    * The Appellant failed to prove that it had knowledge of the Respondent's Director's alleged corrupt acts at the time of terminating the agreement.
    * The Respondent presented sufficient documentary evidence to support its claim for outstanding invoices and damages for business loss.
    * The award of nominal damages was justified based on the evidence presented and the principles of law.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The Court found that the Respondent's amendment of the claim did not constitute an additional claim and was within the scope of the reference to arbitration.
    * The Court held that the Appellant failed to establish that it had knowledge of the Respondent's Director's alleged corrupt acts at the time of terminating the contract.
    * The Court concluded that the Appellant's termination of the CISP agreement was unjustified.
    * The Court found that the arbitral tribunal's award of damages for outstanding invoices was not based on sufficient evidence and was thus vitiated by patent illegality.
    * The Court also determined that the award of nominal damages for business loss and the award of costs of arbitration were not supported by sufficient evidence and suffered from patent illegality. 

* **Interpretation of Law:** 
    * The Court carefully interpreted relevant provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, and other relevant statutes to determine the scope of the reference to arbitration, the grounds for setting aside an arbitral award, and the principles governing damages for breach of contract.
    * The Court relied on various precedents cited by both parties to support its analysis and reasoning.
* **Application of Law:** 
    * The Court applied the relevant legal principles to the facts of the case, concluding that the Appellant failed to meet the burden of proof necessary to justify its termination of the CISP agreement and that the arbitral tribunal's award suffered from patent illegality in awarding damages.

## 6. Judgment

* **Final Decision:** The appeal was allowed in part. The Court set aside the arbitral award to the extent it awarded damages for outstanding invoices, nominal damages for business loss, and costs of arbitration. 
* **Relief Granted:** The Court granted relief to the Appellant by setting aside the arbitral award to the extent mentioned above.
* **Orders:** The Court ordered that the award be set aside to the extent specified, and that the Appellant be awarded costs.

## 7. Implications

* **Impact on Law:** 
    * The judgment highlights the importance of establishing knowledge of breach at the time of termination in cases involving repudiation of contracts. 
    * It underscores the requirement for sufficient evidence to support claims for damages in arbitration proceedings. 
    * The judgment further emphasizes the narrow scope of judicial review of arbitral awards, particularly on the grounds of patent illegality.
* **Future Relevance:**

    * The case also emphasizes the importance of clearly defining the scope of arbitration in contracts to prevent disputes regarding the arbitrability of claims.
* **Broader Context:**  
    * This case demonstrates the courts' increasing focus on ensuring fairness and transparency in arbitration proceedings.
