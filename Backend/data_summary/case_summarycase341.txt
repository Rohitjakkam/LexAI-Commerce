## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Plaintiff’s Argument (BPCL):**
    * **Inherent Jurisdiction:** BPCL argued that execution proceedings, as they arise after the termination of arbitral proceedings under Section 32 of the Arbitration Act, are not "applications arising out of arbitration" within the meaning of Section 10(3) of the Commercial Courts Act. Therefore, the Commercial Court lacked inherent jurisdiction to entertain the execution petitions.
    * **Territorial Jurisdiction:** BPCL contended that the Commercial Court in Lucknow lacked territorial jurisdiction because the petroleum outlet was located in Bahraich, and the only office that could reinstate Modi's dealership was BPCL's Gonda office.  
* **Defendant’s Argument (Modi):**
    * **Enforcement of Award:** Modi argued that the Supreme Court, in Sundaram Finance Limited and Cheran Properties Limited cases, had clarified that an award holder can file execution proceedings at any place of their choice, regardless of the location of the arbitral proceedings. 
    * **Territorial Jurisdiction:** Modi argued that the award was delivered in Lucknow, and as the Arbitrator was appointed by the High Court at Lucknow, the Commercial Court in Lucknow had territorial jurisdiction.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The court rejected BPCL's argument that execution proceedings were not "applications arising out of arbitration" under Section 10(3) of the Commercial Courts Act.
    * The court affirmed the Supreme Court's rulings in Sundaram Finance Limited and Cheran Properties Limited cases, holding that an award holder can choose the location for execution proceedings.
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The court interpreted Section 10(3) of the Commercial Courts Act to include execution proceedings within the scope of "applications arising out of arbitration."

    * The court applied the Supreme Court's interpretation of Section 36 of the Arbitration Act, which allows for the enforcement of an award in the same manner as a decree.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The court applied the Supreme Court's rulings in Sundaram Finance Limited and Cheran Properties Limited cases to determine that the Commercial Court in Lucknow had territorial jurisdiction to hear the execution applications.
