## 4. Arguments Presented

    * The word "Rose" is common and cannot be monopolized.

    * The Appellants' mark 'UNICON SWEET ROSE' is not deceptively similar to 'MADHUR ROSE POP LOLLIPOPS'.

    * The Appellants' use of the rose-shaped lollipop and similar mark is infringing and causes confusion.

    * The Court found that the Appellants' packaging was not deceptively similar to the Respondents'.

    * The Court concluded that the Respondents had not met the threshold to prove that their rose-shaped lollipop had acquired a secondary meaning and was not generic.
