**4. Arguments Presented**

* **Plaintiff’s Argument:** 
    * The Petitioner, as a broker, had sold goods on their behalf to various traders and collected the payment.
    * Despite collecting payments, the Petitioner failed to pay the due amount to the Respondent.
    * This constituted a breach of their agreement and fraudulent conduct, giving rise to a cause of action for the suit.
    * The Respondent was entitled to produce photostat copies of payment receipts as secondary evidence because the original receipts were in the possession of the Petitioner.
    * The Respondent had taken sufficient steps to call for the original documents by filing an application under Order XI Rule 12 & 14 CPC.
    * Notice under Section 66 of the Evidence Act was not required because the Petitioner was aware of the Respondent's intention to produce photostat copies.
* **Defendant’s Argument:**
    * The Respondent's plaint did not disclose a cause of action because it failed to mention the purchasers who bought the goods.
    * The Petitioner was not a sole proprietorship but a partnership firm, and therefore, the proper parties were not included in the suit.
    * The Respondent was not entitled to produce secondary evidence because they had not fulfilled the requirements of Section 65 of the Evidence Act.
    * The Respondent had not served proper notice under Section 66 of the Evidence Act before seeking to produce secondary evidence.
    * The Respondent's application under Section 65 was not maintainable because their previous application under Order XI Rule 12 & 14 CPC had been rejected.
