## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Appellant’s Argument:** 
    * The OSA was not independent of other agreements and SWPL had breached its obligations under those contracts.
    * S&W was not entitled to the invoiced amount due to alleged deficiencies in the Project.
    * The order to furnish a Bank Guarantee was an attachment before decree and did not meet the conditions under Order XXXVIII Rule 5 of the CPC.
* **Respondent’s Argument:** 
    * The OSA was independent of other agreements and S&W had fulfilled its obligations under the OSA.
    * SIPL was in breach of the OSA by not paying the invoiced amount.
    * The court has wide powers under Section 9 of the A&C Act and the order to furnish a Bank Guarantee was justified considering the strong prima facie case and balance of convenience in favor of S&W.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:** 
    * The court found that S&W had established a prima facie case regarding its entitlement to payment under the OSA.
    * The court found that the balance of convenience was in favor of S&W, as they were unsecured for the Offshore Supplies.
    * The court held that the order to furnish a Bank Guarantee was in the nature of an attachment before decree and required compliance with Order XXXVIII Rule 5 of the CPC.
* **Interpretation of Law:** 
    * The court interpreted Section 9 of the A&C Act to provide wide powers for interim measures but emphasized that these powers are not unrestricted and must adhere to the principles of the CPC.
    * The court cited numerous precedents highlighting the need for a strong prima facie case, balance of convenience, and evidence of the respondent's intent to frustrate enforcement of the award.
* **Application of Law:** 
    * The court applied the principle that while interim orders under Section 9 of the A&C Act can be granted, they must be guided by the principles of the CPC, specifically Order XXXVIII Rule 5.
    * The court found that the order to furnish a Bank Guarantee was not justified in this case because S&W had not proven that the appellants were acting in a manner that would frustrate the enforcement of an arbitral award.

## 6. Judgment

* **Final Decision:** The court allowed the appeals to the limited extent of setting aside the direction for the appellants to provide a Bank Guarantee.
* **Relief Granted:** The court relieved the appellants from the obligation to furnish a Bank Guarantee.
* **Orders:** The court clarified that all other interim measures of protection granted in the impugned order remained operative. 

## 7. Implications

* **Future Relevance:** This case provides guidance for future cases involving applications for interim measures under Section 9 of the A&C Act, emphasizing the need for a clear demonstration of the respondent's intent to frustrate enforcement of the award.
* **Broader Context:** The judgment highlights the importance of ensuring fairness and protecting the rights of both parties in arbitration proceedings, particularly regarding the application of interim measures.
