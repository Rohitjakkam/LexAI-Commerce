(respondent), stemming from an agreement signed in 2015. This agreement included an arbitration clause, leading to an arbitral award in favor of the respondent in 2019.

    * **Applicability of Pre-Institution Mediation under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015:** Whether the provisions of Section 12A of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, requiring pre-institution mediation, applied to an application under Section 34 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 for setting aside an arbitral award.
    * **Jurisdiction of Courts:** Whether the Commercial Court, East District (Karkardooma Courts) had jurisdiction over the matter given the parties' agreement on the place of arbitration.

## 4. Arguments Presented

• **Appellant’s Argument:**
    * The time spent pursuing mediation after the first petition was rejected should be excluded from the limitation period under Section 14 of the Limitation Act.
    * The delay in filing the third petition was due to the erroneous orders of the courts, and therefore, the outer limit for condonation of delay should be extended due to the Supreme Court's order in Cognizance for Extension of Limitation. 
    * The seat of arbitration was Delhi, not Connaught Place, and the Karkardooma Courts had jurisdiction to entertain the application.

• **Respondent’s Argument:**
    * The first petition was filed beyond the limitation period, and the delay was not condonable.
    * The provisions of Section 12A of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, did not apply to an application under Section 34 of the A&C Act, and the appellant should have appealed the order rejecting the first petition.
    * The benefit of the Cognizance for Extension of Limitation order was not available as the limitation period had already expired.
    * Connaught Place was the seat of arbitration, and the Patiala House Courts had exclusive jurisdiction.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

• **Key Findings:**
    * The court found that the appellant's initial delay in filing the first petition was condonable.
    * The Commercial Court, Karkardooma, had erroneously applied Section 12A of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, to the application under Section 34 of the A&C Act, and the period spent on mediation should be excluded from the limitation period.
    * The court rejected the respondent's argument that the appellant should have appealed the order rejecting the first petition.
    * The court concluded that the seat of arbitration was Delhi, not Connaught Place, based on the arbitration clause in the agreement.
    * The court found that the Karkardooma Courts had jurisdiction to entertain the application, as they were the Court as defined in Section 2(1)(e) of the A&C Act and both parties carried on their business activities within their territorial jurisdiction.
    * The court applied the principle of *Actus Curiae Neminem Gravabit* to remedy the prejudice caused by the erroneous court orders.

• **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The court interpreted Section 12A of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, as not applicable to applications under Section 34 of the A&C Act.
    * The court interpreted Section 20 of the A&C Act to mean that the seat of arbitration is not determined by the location of the hearings but by the parties' agreement or the Arbitral Tribunal's decision.
    * The court analyzed previous judgments on the concept of "seat of arbitration" and its relation to jurisdiction.
    * The court interpreted the Cognizance for Extension of Limitation order as applicable to determining the outer limit for condoning delay.

    * The court applied Section 14 of the Limitation Act to exclude the time spent on mediation.
