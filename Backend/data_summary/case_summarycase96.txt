## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Plaintiff’s Argument:**
    * The suit against the Bank was not frivolous or vexatious, as alleged by the Bank.
    * The Bank's actions, including the initiation of proceedings under SARFESI Act and taking symbolic possession of assets, caused significant damage to the plaintiffs.
    * The Bank's refusal to release working capital had severely impacted the plaintiffs' business operations.
* **Defendant’s Argument:**
    * The suit was frivolous and vexatious, filed to avoid liability for repayment of Bank dues.
    * The Bank had already initiated legal proceedings under the SARFESI Act and taken symbolic possession of assets, thus, the suit was unnecessary.
    * The provisions of CPC concerning written statements were procedural in nature and should be interpreted liberally.
    * The Bank had sufficient cause for the delay in filing the written statement and the Commercial Court should have condoned the delay.
