* **Legal Doctrines:**
    * **Principles of Interpretation:** The Court interpreted the language of the relevant statutes and rules. 
    * **Final Order vs Interlocutory Order:** The Court addressed the distinction between final orders and interlocutory orders in the context of Section 9 applications.
    * **Scope of Discretionary Powers:** The Court acknowledged the discretionary power of the Courts but recognized that such powers must be exercised based on certain principles.

**4. Arguments Presented**

* **Appellant’s Argument:**
    * The power to grant interim orders under Section 9 of the Act, 1996 includes the power to grant ex-parte interim orders, as acknowledged by the Rules, 2001. 
    * An order declining an ex-parte interim measure is an appealable order under Section 37 of the Act, 1996.
    * The precedent established in M/s. Sorting Hat Technologies Private Limited vs. Sri Vishal Vivek Tiwari, and other cited judgments, supports their argument.
* **Respondent’s Argument:**
    * Appeals under Section 37 of the Act, 1996 are only maintainable against interlocutory orders specifically enumerated in Order XLIII of the Code, as per the proviso to Section 13(1A) of the Act, 2015.
    * The impugned order is not a final order under Section 9 of the Act, 1996, as the application is still pending before the learned District Judge.
    * The order in M/s. Sorting Hat Technologies Private Limited is not binding precedent and the decision in Symphony Services Corporation (India) Private Limited, Bangalore should be followed. 
    * An appeal against an order refusing ex-parte interim measure would defeat the purpose of the Act, 1996 and Act, 2015, as per the Apex Court's decision in BGS SGS SOMA JV Vs. NHPC LTD.
    * The dispute is not a commercial dispute, rendering the appeal itself inadmissible before the High Court.

**5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning**

* **Key Findings:**
    * The Court found that the language of Rule 9 of Rules, 2001 suggests that ex-parte interim measures, if granted, are in exercise of power under Section 9 of the Act, 1996. 
    * The Court analyzed the interplay of Section 9 and 37 of the Act, 1996, Section 13 of the Act, 2015, and Rule 9 of Rules, 2001.
    * The Court determined that the order refusing an ex-parte interim measure is a final order as it definitively denies the specific relief sought.
* **Interpretation of Law:** 
    * The Court emphasized the non-obstante clause in Section 37 of the Act, 1996, indicating its overriding effect.
    * The Court noted that Section 13 of the Act, 2015 limits appealable orders under Order XLIII of the Code, but this does not affect the scope of Section 37 of the Act, 1996.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The Court applied the principles of interpretation to conclude that the expression "granting or refusing to grant any measure under Section 9" in Section 37 of the Act, 1996, encompasses ex-parte interim measures.
    * The Court distinguished the precedents cited by both parties, clarifying that some judgments addressed different legal issues and were not directly applicable.

**6. Judgment**

* **Final Decision:** The appeal was disposed of. 
* **Relief Granted:** The case was remitted back to the Commercial Court (the Section 9 Court) to consider the application for interim measure under Section 9 of the Act, 1996. The interim protection granted by the High Court to the Appellant was extended until the Section 9 application was finally disposed of.
* **Orders:**
    * The Section 9 Court was directed to hear the objections of the Respondents expeditiously and to cooperate with the parties for early disposal of the application. 
    * The High Court did not address the issue of whether the dispute was a commercial dispute and directed the Commercial Court to consider this if not already decided.

**7. Implications**

* **Impact on Law:**
    * This judgment clarifies that an order granting or refusing an ex-parte interim measure under Section 9 of the Act, 1996 is appealable under Section 37 of the Act, 1996, even when the Section 9 application is before a Commercial Court.
    * This decision overrules the previous decision in Symphony Services Corporation (India) Private Limited, Bangalore vs. Sudip Bhattacharjee. 
* **Future Relevance:**
    * This judgment is likely to influence future legal decisions regarding the appealability of orders on ex-parte interim measures under Section 9 of the Act, 1996. 
* **Broader Context:**
    * This judgment is significant for parties involved in arbitration proceedings, as it clarifies their rights to appeal certain orders.

**8. Summary Points**

* Appeals against orders granting or refusing ex-parte interim measures under Section 9 of the Act, 1996 are maintainable under Section 37 of the Act, 1996.
* The proviso to Section 13(1A) of the Act, 2015 does not restrict appeals under Section 37 of the Act, 1996.
* The scope of interference by the appellate court is limited in these appeals, focusing primarily on whether the ex-parte order could be deferred until the respondent is heard. 
* The decision in Symphony Services Corporation (India) Private Limited, Bangalore vs. Sudip Bhattacharjee has been overruled.
