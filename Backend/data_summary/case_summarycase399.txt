    * Defendant No. 1 failed to file a written statement despite ample time, including after the transfer to the Commercial Division. 
    * The 120-day time frame for filing written statements under the Code of Civil Procedure is applicable to the Commercial Division, even for cases transferred from the Original Side.
    * The arbitration proceeding in Jabalpur does not affect the present suit, which deals with a bank guarantee issued by a different party.
* **Defendant’s Argument:**
    * The arbitration proceeding in Jabalpur covers the same contract and should be considered for dismissing the suit.
    * The Plaintiff company does not exist according to the records of the Registrar of Companies, making the suit not maintainable.
    * The 120-day time frame under the Code of Civil Procedure is not applicable to the Original Side of the Calcutta High Court.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    *  The Commercial Courts Act, 2015, with its emphasis on speedy disposal of commercial disputes, introduced a new procedural regime for commercial suits.
    *  Section 16(2) of the Act mandates the Commercial Division to follow the amended provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.
    *  Section 15(4) of the Act allows the Commercial Division to prescribe new timelines for suits transferred from the Original Side, overriding the 120-day time frame.
    *  The arbitration proceeding in Jabalpur deals with a different subject matter than the present suit and therefore cannot be used to dismiss the case.
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    *  The court interpreted the relevant provisions of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, and the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, emphasizing the intent of the Act to provide speedy justice in commercial cases.

* **Application of Law:**
    *  The court applied the principle that a new timeline for filing written statements could be prescribed by the Commercial Division even after a transfer, regardless of the time elapsed before the transfer.
    *  The court considered the delay in filing the written statement by the Defendant No. 1, concluding that it was not a sufficient ground to close the doors of justice.
