##  1. Case Title

* **Case Name:** Shri Balaji Industrial Products Limited vs. AIA Engineering Limited and Ors.
* **Court:** Rajasthan High Court
* **Date of Judgment:** 2nd July, 2018
* **Citation:** D.B. Civil Writ Petition No. 4411/2018

## 2. Background and Context

* **Brief Overview:** AIA Engineering Limited (AIA), the plaintiff, filed a suit against Shri Balaji Industrial Products Limited (Balaji), the defendant, alleging infringement of AIA's patented product. Balaji filed an application under Order VII Rule 11 CPC challenging the maintainability of the suit. This application was dismissed by the Commercial Court, leading to Balaji filing a writ petition in the Rajasthan High Court, which was also dismissed. Later, AIA filed an application under Order V Rule 1 CPC to close Balaji's right to file a written statement. Balaji then filed an application under Order VI Rule 15A CPC arguing that the suit was not duly instituted as the plaint was not accompanied by a "Statement of Truth" as required under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015. The Commercial Court dismissed this application and allowed AIA to file the "Statement of Truth" later. Balaji filed the current writ petition challenging the Commercial Court's order. 
* **Key Issues:** 
    * Whether the Commercial Court erred in allowing AIA to file the "Statement of Truth" belatedly, after Balaji had already filed a written statement.
    * Whether the suit was not "duly instituted" as per Section 26 CPC due to the absence of the "Statement of Truth" in the plaint.
    * Whether Balaji was obligated to file a written statement within 120 days, even when an application under Order VII Rule 11 CPC was pending.
    * Whether the retrospective amendment introduced by the Ordinance of 2018, which re-introduced the "Statement of Truth" provision, applied to this case.

## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Plaintiff’s Argument (AIA):**
    * The Commercial Court's order dismissing Balaji's application under Order VI Rule 15A was correct. 
    * The suit was "duly instituted" as per Section 26 CPC, even without the "Statement of Truth" initially, as the requirement for the "Statement of Truth" is not mandatory.
    * The application under Order V Rule 1 CPC to close Balaji's right to file a written statement was valid, as Balaji had not filed the written statement within the 120 days time frame prescribed under Order V Rule 1.
    * The retrospective amendment in the Ordinance of 2018 was intended to avoid the invalidation of suits filed before the notification of the Act of 2015 and was not meant to invalidate suits filed after the notification of the Act of 2015, including the current case. 
    * Any procedural defects are curable, and AIA had already filed the "Statement of Truth" conforming to the format provided in the Ordinance.
* **Defendant’s Argument (Balaji):**
    * The Commercial Court committed a jurisdictional error by closing Balaji's right to file a written statement while Balaji's application under Order VI Rule 15A was pending.
    * The suit was not "duly instituted" as per Section 26 CPC, as the plaint lacked the "Statement of Truth".
    * Balaji was not obligated to file a written statement within 120 days because an application under Order VII Rule 11 CPC was pending.
    * The retrospective amendment introduced by the Ordinance of 2018 applies to this case and renders the suit invalid due to the absence of the "Statement of Truth" at the time of filing.
    * The "Statement of Truth" is a mandatory requirement and its absence makes the suit defective.
    * The Commercial Court erred in accepting the belated "Statement of Truth" filed by AIA. 
    * Balaji had no other alternative remedy available to challenge the Commercial Court's order.
