## 4. Arguments Presented

**Plaintiff's Argument:**
* The defendant's press releases and letters published outside India, but targeting the diamond industry in India, especially Surat, directly impacted the plaintiff's reputation and business in Surat.
* The defendant's actions, including the letters from Rogers & Hollands Jewelers, were intended to harm the plaintiff's business relationships and reputation in Surat.
* The Surat Court has jurisdiction because the cause of action arises, in part, within its territorial limits.
* The defendant's subsidiary company in Surat is a factor supporting the court's jurisdiction.
* The plaintiff's earlier lawsuit in Vadodara, even though returned for lack of jurisdiction, strengthens the claim that the cause of action arises in India.

**Defendant's Argument:**
* The defendant's press releases and letters were published outside India and did not specifically target the plaintiff.
* The defendant's press releases were based on legal actions taken in India and were not intended to harm the plaintiff's business.
* The defendant's principal business operations are in Israel, and no cause of action arose within the territorial jurisdiction of the Surat Court.
* The fact that the defendant has a subsidiary company in Surat does not give the Surat Court jurisdiction over the defendant itself.
* The plaintiff's suit is barred by Section 34 and 41 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963, because the plaintiff seeks relief beyond a mere declaration of title and is attempting to restrain judicial proceedings in another court.

## 5. Courtâ€™s Analysis and Reasoning

**Key Findings:**
* The court recognized the defendant's press releases and letters, although published outside India, were aimed at the diamond industry in India, specifically Surat.
* The court found that the plaintiff presented prima facie evidence suggesting the defendant's actions harmed the plaintiff's business and reputation in Surat.
* The court acknowledged that the plaintiff had previously filed a suit in Vadodara, which was returned for lack of jurisdiction, indicating that the cause of action arose in India.

**Interpretation of Law:**
* The court interpreted Section 20 of the CPC to mean that if a corporation has a subordinate office at a particular location and a cause of action arises there, the court at that location has jurisdiction.
* The court held that the defendant's subsidiary company in Surat, though a separate entity, is relevant to the question of jurisdiction.
* The court did not find the plaintiff's suit barred by Section 34 or 41 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963. The court recognized that the plaintiff sought various reliefs beyond a mere declaration of title and that the defendant's actions were not entirely confined to judicial proceedings in another court.

**Application of Law:**
* Applying the principle of "tortious interference," the court found that the defendant's actions, despite being carried out outside India, could still have a significant impact on the plaintiff's business within India.
* The court concluded that the Surat Court had territorial jurisdiction based on the plaintiff's allegations of harm to their business in Surat, the defendant's subsidiary company in Surat, and the previous lawsuit filed in Vadodara.
* The court dismissed the defendant's argument regarding the Specific Relief Act, 1963, finding that the plaintiff's suit sought a range of remedies and the defendant's actions extended beyond purely judicial proceedings.

## 6. Judgment

**Final Decision:** The High Court dismissed the petition filed by Sarine Technologies Ltd. 

**Relief Granted:** No relief was granted to the defendant, and the impugned order of the trial court dismissing the application under Order VII, Rule 11 of the CPC was upheld. 

**Orders:** The High Court directed the trial court in Surat to expeditiously dispose of the suit (Special Civil Suit No. 191 of 2018) within six months, urging both parties to cooperate. The interim relief granted to the defendant was vacated.
