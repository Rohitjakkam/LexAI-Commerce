* **Case Name:** Spacetech Equipments And Structurals Pvt. Ltd. vs. Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. And Anr. 
* **Court:** Bombay High Court (Commercial Division)
* **Date of Judgment:** 27th February, 2019
* **Citation:** Not available in the provided text.

## 2. Background and Context

**Brief Overview:**

This judgment addresses the interpretation of amendments to the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC) introduced by the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 ("Commercial Courts Act"). The amendment in question pertains to Order VIII Rule 1, which sets a 120-day limit for defendants to file a written statement in commercial suits. The case arose when various defendants in multiple commercial suits failed to file their written statements within the stipulated time and sought condonation of delay. 

**Key Issues:**

1. Whether the amended Order VIII Rule 1, as introduced by the Commercial Courts Act, is mandatory or directory.
2. Whether the Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules, 1980 ("Bombay High Court Rules") override the amendments introduced by the Commercial Courts Act.
3. Whether the court retains discretion under Order VIII Rule 9 of the CPC to take on record belated written statements despite the amendments introduced by the Commercial Courts Act.

**Legal Doctrines:**

* **Harmonious Construction**:  The court must interpret various statutory provisions in a way that gives effect to all of them.
* **'Mischief Rule'**:  This rule requires the court to consider the common law before the act, the mischief intended to be remedied, the remedy provided by Parliament, and the true reason for the remedy.
* **Mandatory vs. Directory Provisions**:  The court must determine whether a provision is mandatory, meaning it must be strictly followed, or directory, meaning it provides guidance but non-compliance does not necessarily invalidate the act.
* **Non-Obstante Clause**:  This clause indicates that the provision it introduces overrides any conflicting provisions.
* **Stare Decisis**:  The principle that courts should follow previous decisions on similar issues.
* **Dura Lex Sed Lex**:  This maxim means "the law is harsh, but it is the law."  It signifies that courts must enforce the law as written, even if it leads to a harsh outcome.
* **Res Judicata**:  The principle that a matter that has been decided by a court cannot be re-litigated.
* **Inherent Powers of the Court**:  The court's authority to pass orders necessary for the ends of justice. 

## 4. Arguments Presented

**Plaintiff’s Argument:**

* **Mr. Nausher Kohli** and other plaintiffs' counsel argued that the amendments to the CPC introduced by the Commercial Courts Act are mandatory and leave no discretion with the Commercial Division to take on record written statements after 120 days.
* They relied on the Apex Court's decision in M/s SCG Contracts India Pvt. Ltd. Vs. K.S. Chamankar Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. (supra) and various Delhi High Court judgments that interpreted the amendments as mandatory. 
* They stressed the object and purpose of the Commercial Courts Act to reduce delays and provide for speedy disposal of commercial cases.
* They argued that Section 16 of the Commercial Courts Act specifically states that the Commercial Division must follow the amended CPC provisions, and Section 16(3) clarifies that the amended CPC provisions prevail over any conflicting High Court rules.
* They asserted that Section 21 of the Commercial Courts Act provides the Act overriding effect over other laws, including the Bombay High Court Rules.
* They argued that allowing belated written statements under Order VIII Rule 9 would render the amendments to Order VIII Rule 1 meaningless.
* They contended that the Bombay High Court Rules cannot override the Commercial Courts Act because it is a later special act.
* They maintained that relying on older case law like Shailaja and Chintaman is inappropriate because those decisions were based on the CPC before the Commercial Courts Act amendments.

**Defendant’s Argument:**

* **Mr. J.P. Sen, Mr. Zal Andhyarujina, Mr. Rashmin Khandekar, Mr. Rohan Kelkar, Mr. Chirag Mody, Mr. Sandeep Pendse, Ms. Deepa Ahuja, Mr. Pushkal Mishra, and Mr. Rohit Gupta** argued that the Bombay High Court Rules, being special laws, override the amendments to the CPC introduced by the Commercial Courts Act.
* They relied on the Apex Court's decision in Iridium India Telecom Ltd vs Motorola INC (supra), which held that the Bombay High Court Rules govern proceedings on the original side of the High Court, not the CPC.
* They argued that Section 16(3) of the Commercial Courts Act does not explicitly exclude the Bombay High Court Rules, and therefore, the Bombay High Court retains the power to condone delay under its own rules.
* They contended that Order VIII Rules 9 and 10 preserve the court's discretion to take on record belated written statements, even after the 120-day limit.
* They argued that the amended Order VIII Rule 1 only bars the defendant's right to file a written statement, not the court's power to accept a belated written statement under Order VIII Rule 9.
* They cited various judgments like Kailash vs. Nankhu (supra), Shailaja, and Chintaman to support their argument that the court retains discretion to condone delay in exceptional circumstances.
* They argued that the court's inherent powers allow it to consider equitable considerations and prevent injustice, even if it means deviating from a strict interpretation of the Commercial Courts Act.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

**Key Findings:**

* The court acknowledged the Apex Court's decision in M/s SCG Contracts India Pvt. Ltd. Vs. K.S. Chamankar Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. (supra), which held that the amended provisions of the CPC in relation to commercial disputes are mandatory.
* The court found that the language of the amended Order VIII Rule 1 is unambiguous and leaves no discretion with the Commercial Division to take on record written statements after 120 days. 
* The court determined that the Bombay High Court Rules cannot override the Commercial Courts Act, as the Commercial Courts Act is a later special act and the non-obstante clause in Section 21 makes it clear that the Act prevails over other laws.
* The court concluded that Order VIII Rule 9 cannot be used to circumvent the mandatory provisions of the Commercial Courts Act regarding the 120-day limit for filing written statements. 
* The court held that the inherent powers of the court cannot be used to override the clear and mandatory provisions of the Commercial Courts Act.

**Interpretation of Law:**

* The court interpreted the amended Order VIII Rule 1 as mandatory, meaning that no written statement can be taken on record after 120 days, regardless of the circumstances. 
* The court interpreted Section 16(3) of the Commercial Courts Act as applying to all High Court rules, including those of the Bombay High Court.
* The court interpreted Section 21 of the Commercial Courts Act as giving the Act overriding effect over the Bombay High Court Rules.
* The court determined that Order VIII Rule 9, even though discretionary, cannot be used to circumvent the mandatory 120-day limit in commercial suits.
* The court clarified that "Rule" as used in Section 16(3) of the Commercial Courts Act covers the Bombay High Court Rules, as these rules are made under Section 129 of the CPC.

**Application of Law:**

* The court applied the principle of harmonious construction to interpret the various provisions of the Commercial Courts Act and CPC, ensuring that all provisions are given effect.
* The court applied the 'Mischief Rule' to understand the intent of the Commercial Courts Act and its amendments, recognizing that the mischief was delays in commercial cases and the remedy was to impose strict time limits.
* The court applied the principle that a later special act overrides an earlier special act to determine that the Commercial Courts Act prevails over the Bombay High Court Rules.
* The court applied the principle that general provisions yield to specific provisions to determine that Order VIII Rule 9 must be read down to be consistent with the specific provisions of the Commercial Courts Act.
* The court applied the maxim "dura lex sed lex" to emphasize that the court cannot disregard the clear provisions of the law, even if they lead to a harsh outcome.

## 6. Judgment

**Final Decision:**

* The court ruled that the defendant cannot file a written statement in a commercial suit after 120 days from the date of service of summons. 
* The court found in favor of the plaintiffs and against the defendants.

**Relief Granted:**

**Orders:**

* The court ordered that the question of law be decided as stated above.
* The court recommended that the Bombay High Court should revise its Original Side Rules to harmonize them with the Commercial Courts Act. 
* The court also recommended that the Bombay High Court implement strict timelines for plaintiffs in commercial suits to ensure expeditious disposal of cases.
