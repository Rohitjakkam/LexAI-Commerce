## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Plaintiff’s Argument:**
    * The suit was filed on 18th August, 2016, before the notification of the Specified Value.
    * The Commercial Courts Act, 2015, does not specify the Specified Value itself, leaving it to be determined by the State Government.
    * As the Specified Value was notified on 20th March, 2020, the suit was "pending" at that time, making it eligible for transfer under Section 15 of the Act. 
    * The Commercial Division was established by Notification dated 16th July, 2016, and the suit was filed after that, therefore, the suit was pending in the Ordinary Original Civil Jurisdiction at the time of establishment.
    * The judgment in Laxmi Polyfab Private Limited case supports the plaintiff's argument regarding the applicability of Section 15.

* **Defendant’s Argument:**
    * The suit was filed after the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 came into force (23rd October, 2015) and after the establishment of the Commercial Division in Calcutta (16th July, 2016). 
    * The Notification dated 20th March, 2020, only specified the pecuniary jurisdiction of the Commercial Court and did not establish it.
    * The defendant’s counterclaim should be withdrawn and filed in the appropriate forum. 
    * The order dated 2nd March, 2023, transferring the suit to the Commercial Division was based on an error apparent on the face of record as the court mistakenly considered the Commercial Courts Act coming into force in December 2015 and the establishment of the Commercial Court in March 2020. 

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The Commercial Division of Calcutta High Court was established by the Notification dated 16th July, 2016.

    * The court recognized that the Specified Value is not defined in the Act itself but delegated to be determined by the State Government.
