* **Key Findings:**
    * The Court scrutinized the relevant provisions of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, particularly Sections 3 and 10.
    * It noted that the Act establishes Commercial Courts at the district level, without a lower hierarchy within that structure.
    * The Court cited the Apex Court's decision in the Atlanta Limited case, emphasizing that the court of superior most jurisdiction within the district is the competent court for arbitration matters.
    * The Court also analyzed a notification issued by the State of Gujarat regarding the designation of specific judges in Vadodara district for exercising jurisdiction under the Commercial Courts Act. 

* **Interpretation of Law:** The Court interpreted the Commercial Courts Act to establish a distinct and superior level of jurisdiction for commercial disputes, including arbitration matters, within the district level. It rejected the argument that the jurisdiction should be exercised by a lower court based on traditional hierarchy.

* **Application of Law:** The Court applied its interpretation of the law to the specific facts of the case. It concluded that the Principal Senior Civil Judge, Bodeli, District: Vadodara, as designated in the notification, is the competent court for executing the arbitration award in question.

## 6. Judgment
