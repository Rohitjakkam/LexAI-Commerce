* **Case Name:** M/S Delhi Chemical And Pharmaceutical Works Pvt. Ltd. & Anr. vs. Himgiri Realtors Pvt. Ltd. & Anr.
* **Court:** Delhi High Court
* **Date of Judgment:** 5th July, 2021
* **Citation:** AIRONLINE 2021 DEL 1955

## 2. Background and Context

* **Brief Overview:** This case involves a dispute over the execution of an arbitral award. The respondent, Himgiri Realtors Pvt. Ltd. (Decree Holder), had obtained an arbitral award against the appellants, Delhi Chemical and Pharmaceutical Works Pvt. Ltd. and Ameet Sharma (Judgment Debtors), for a sum of Rs. 21,17,80,487. The Decree Holder filed an execution petition seeking enforcement of the award as a decree of the court. The Judgment Debtors argued that the Decree Holder was already in possession of a valuable property belonging to them, exceeding the amount of the award, and therefore, no further disclosure of assets was required. They also challenged the procedure laid down in Bhandari Engineers & Builders Pvt. Ltd. vs. Maharia Raj Joint Venture, a prior Delhi High Court judgment, which mandated the filing of detailed affidavits of assets and income by judgment debtors in execution proceedings.
* **Key Issues:** 
    * Maintainability of the appeal against the order directing the filing of affidavits in execution proceedings.
    * Whether the Commercial Division of the Delhi High Court has jurisdiction to entertain execution petitions arising from arbitral awards in commercial disputes.
    * Whether the procedure for disclosure of assets laid down in Bhandari Engineers & Builders Pvt. Ltd. vs. Maharia Raj Joint Venture is valid and applicable in all cases.

## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Appellants’ Argument:**
    * The Commercial Division erred in directing the Judgment Debtors to file affidavits of assets without an application from the Decree Holder and without the decree remaining unsatisfied.
    * The Decree Holder was already in possession of a property belonging to the Judgment Debtors, exceeding the amount of the award, providing sufficient security for the decretal amount.
    * The procedure prescribed in Bhandari Engineers & Builders Pvt. Ltd. vs. Maharia Raj Joint Venture for disclosure of assets was not applicable in this case and was excessively intrusive, infringing the Judgment Debtors' right to privacy.
    * The Commercial Division did not have jurisdiction to entertain the execution petition as it was not an application arising out of arbitration under the Arbitration Act.
    * The appeal was maintainable under Section 13(1A) of the Commercial Courts Act, notwithstanding the proviso restricting appeals to orders enumerated in Order XLIII of the CPC.
* **Respondents’ Argument:**
    * The Judgment Debtors' offer to file affidavits in sealed covers in the review petition estopped them from challenging the order directing the filing of affidavits.
    * The Commercial Division had jurisdiction to entertain the execution petition as the subject matter of the arbitration was a commercial dispute of a specified value.
    * The procedure laid down in Bhandari Engineers & Builders Pvt. Ltd. vs. Maharia Raj Joint Venture was necessary to ensure expeditious execution of decrees and prevent delay.
    * The Decree Holder was not aware of all the assets of the Judgment Debtors, and the affidavits were necessary to trace those assets.
    * The appeal was not maintainable as it challenged an order passed by the Commercial Division, which was not enumerated in Order XLIII of the CPC.
