* **Court:** Bombay High Court, Commercial Division
* **Date of Judgment:** 27th February 2019

## 2. Background and Context

* **Brief Overview:** This case arises from the failure of various defendants to file written statements within the 120-day time limit set by the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 ("Commercial Courts Act"). These defendants then sought condonation of the delay. The Bombay High Court, seeking to settle the controversy, framed a question of law: "Whether in view of the amendment to the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 by 'The Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Act, 2015 (4 of 2016)', the Defendant/s can be allowed to file the Written Statement/s after 120 days from the date of service of the Writ of Summons in a Commercial Suit?" 
* **Key Issues:** 
    * The interpretation of the amended Order VIII Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC), introduced by the Commercial Courts Act, regarding the 120-day time limit for filing written statements in commercial suits.
    * Whether the Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules, 1980 supersede the provisions of the CPC as amended by the Commercial Courts Act.
    * Whether the court has discretion under Order VIII Rules 9 and 10 to allow written statements to be filed after the 120-day period.

* **Legal Doctrines:**
    * **Mischief Rule:** This rule, stemming from Heydon's Case (1584), requires courts to interpret a statute by considering the law before the statute was enacted, the mischief it was intended to address, the remedy provided, and the reason for the remedy.
    * **Harmonious Construction:** This doctrine mandates that different provisions of a statute be interpreted in a way that gives effect to all of them.
    * **Non Obstante Clause:** These clauses, beginning with "Notwithstanding anything contained in...", override other provisions within the same statute or other laws.
    * **Statutory Interpretation:** This field of law involves interpreting the meaning of legislation and applying it to specific situations.
    * **Mandatory vs. Directory Provisions:** Mandatory provisions must be strictly complied with, while directory provisions can be disregarded without invalidating the action.
    * **Dura lex sed lex:** This Latin maxim means "the law is hard but it is the law," highlighting that even harsh legal consequences must be enforced when mandated by a statute. 
    * **Jurisdiction by Consent:** Jurisdiction cannot be conferred on a court by agreement between parties; it must be granted by a statute. 

## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Plaintiff's Argument:**
    * Mr. Nausher Kohli, representing the plaintiffs, argued that the Commercial Courts Act is a special act intended to expedite the disposal of commercial cases by setting strict timelines. 
    * He emphasized the mandatory language of the amended provisions in Order VIII Rule 1, Order V Rule 1, and Order VIII Rule 10, which state that the 120-day time limit for filing written statements is absolute and non-discretionary. 
    * He argued that the amendments to the CPC introduced by the Commercial Courts Act prevail over the Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules, as evidenced by Sections 16 and 21 of the Commercial Courts Act.
    * He cited various Delhi High Court decisions upholding the mandatory nature of the 120-day limit, as well as the Supreme Court's affirmation of this interpretation in the SCG Contracts case.
    * He further argued that the Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules cannot override the CPC as amended by the Commercial Courts Act, citing the broader purpose of the Commercial Courts Act to reduce judicial delay.
    * He claimed that the court's discretion under Order VIII Rule 9 to call for written statements should be read down to avoid conflict with the 120-day limit and to uphold the purpose of the Commercial Courts Act. 
    * He highlighted that the distinction between commercial suits and non-commercial suits would be undermined if the court allowed for written statements to be filed beyond the 120-day period. 
* **Defendant's Argument:**
    *  Senior Advocate Mr. Anturkar, representing the defendants, argued that the Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules continue to override the CPC, even as amended by the Commercial Courts Act, based on the court's Letters Patent and the power conferred by Section 129 of the CPC.
    * He argued that Section 21 of the Commercial Courts Act, with its "Save as otherwise provided" clause, suggests an exception for the Letters Patent and rules made thereunder. 
    * He claimed that the legislature did not intend to override the Letters Patent except for specific instances like intra-court appeals, as seen in Section 13(2) of the Commercial Courts Act and Section 100 A of the CPC. 
    * He argued that Section 16(3) of the Commercial Courts Act does not cover the Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules, as "Rule" in this section refers to rules framed under Sections 122 or 125 of the CPC, not those under Section 129. 
    * Senior Advocate Mr. J.P. Sen argued that the Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules empower the court to condone the delay and take on record written statements even after the 120-day period, relying on the Supreme Court's decision in Iridium. 
    * Mr. Khandekar, Mr. Pooniwala, and Mr. Kelkar argued that the court's discretion under Order VIII Rules 9 and 10 to call for written statements remains intact even after the amendment to Order VIII Rule 1 introduced by the Commercial Courts Act. 
    * They relied on the Supreme Court's decision in Kailash, arguing that the 120-day time limit in Order VIII Rule 1 is directory, not mandatory, and that the court can exercise its discretion under Order VIII Rule 9 to take on record belated written statements.
    * Mr. Kelkar further argued that "the" written statement in Order VIII Rule 1 is different from "a" written statement in Order VIII Rule 9, suggesting that the 120-day bar applies only to "the" initial written statement and not to subsequent ones. 
    * Mr. Anturkar and Mr. Sen argued that the court can still exercise its powers under the Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules to condone the delay and take on record written statements in commercial suits. 
    * Mr. Sen also argued that the 120-day period should begin from the date a defendant enters its appearance, not from the date of service of the summons, due to a previous notification from the court's office. 

## 5. Courtâ€™s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The Bombay High Court acknowledged the Supreme Court's decision in the SCG Contracts case, reaffirming the Delhi High Court's interpretation of the amendments to Order VIII Rule 1 introduced by the Commercial Courts Act.
    * The court recognized the "dura lex sed lex" principle, emphasizing that even harsh consequences mandated by a statute must be enforced. 
    * The court found that the Commercial Courts Act is a special act that overrides the Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules in cases of conflict, applying the principle of later special acts prevailing over earlier ones.
    * The court held that the 120-day time limit for filing written statements in commercial suits is mandatory and non-discretionary, based on the clear and express provisions of the Commercial Courts Act. 
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The court interpreted the amendments to Order VIII Rule 1 introduced by the Commercial Courts Act as mandatory, not directory, due to the clear consequences of forfeiture and the removal of court discretion.
    * The court interpreted Section 16(3) of the Commercial Courts Act as covering the Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules, as "Rule" in this section refers to rules made under any enactment, not just those under Sections 122 or 125 of the CPC. 
    * The court interpreted the "Save as otherwise provided" clause in Section 21 of the Commercial Courts Act as not providing an exception for the Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules. 
    * The court found that the Supreme Court's decision in Iridium, dealing with a different amendment to the CPC, is not applicable in this case due to the distinct nature of the Commercial Courts Act and the conflict between two special acts.
    * The court distinguished the Supreme Court's decision in Kailash, recognizing that it was based on the CPC before the amendment by the Commercial Courts Act, which did not provide for consequences or restrict court discretion. 
* **Application of Law:**
    * The court applied the principle of harmonious construction to reconcile the different provisions of the CPC as amended by the Commercial Courts Act.
    * The court applied the principle of later special acts prevailing over earlier ones to determine that the Commercial Courts Act overrides the Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules. 
    * The court applied the "dura lex sed lex" principle, enforcing the 120-day time limit even though it may lead to harsh consequences in some cases. 
    * The court applied the principle of "jurisdiction by consent" to reject the argument that consent between parties could confer jurisdiction on the court that was otherwise barred by statute.

## 6. Judgment

* **Final Decision:** The Bombay High Court held that written statements by defendants in commercial suits cannot be taken on record after the expiry of 120 days from the date of service of the Writ of Summons. 
* **Relief Granted:**  No specific relief was granted in this case, as it was a matter of settling a question of law.
* **Orders:** The court directed that its Commercial Division should adhere to the provisions of the CPC as amended by the Commercial Courts Act in adjudicating commercial suits. 

## 7. Implications

* **Future Relevance:** This judgment is likely to be highly relevant in future cases involving the Commercial Courts Act, particularly those concerning the time limit for filing written statements. It sets a precedent for other High Courts to adopt a uniform interpretation of the law.
* **Broader Context:** The case highlights the broader societal need for efficient and expeditious justice in commercial matters, a key objective of the Commercial Courts Act. The court's decision emphasizes the need for courts to uphold the legislative mandate, even if it leads to some hardship in individual cases.
