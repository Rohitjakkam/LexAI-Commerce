    * **Dura lex sed lex:** The law is hard, but it is the law; equitable considerations cannot override the law.

## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Plaintiff’s Argument:**
    * The Commercial Courts Act was enacted to reduce delays and expedite the resolution of commercial disputes.
    * The amendments made to Order V Rule 1, Order VIII Rule 1, and Order VIII Rule 10 of the CPC by the Commercial Courts Act set absolute time limits for filing written statements (120 days).
    * These amendments were intended to override conflicting provisions in the Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules.
    * Sections 16 and 21 of the Commercial Courts Act demonstrate the intent to override all conflicting laws and create a uniform system for commercial disputes.
    * The Delhi High Court consistently interpreted the amended provisions as mandatory and the Supreme Court affirmed this interpretation.
    * Allowing defendants to file written statements beyond 120 days would render the Act's purpose otiose and create disparity across the country.
    * The ‘Mischief Rule’ of statutory interpretation supports the mandatory interpretation of the amendments.
    * Relying on Order VIII Rule 9 to allow late written statements would be an indirect circumvention of the Act.
* **Defendant’s Argument:**
    * The Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules, framed under the Letters Patent,  override the amended provisions of the CPC introduced by the Commercial Courts Act.
    * The Apex Court's decision in Iridium India Telecom Ltd vs Motorola INC supports the primacy of the Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules.
    * The phrase "Rule of the jurisdictional High Court" in Section 16 of the Commercial Courts Act does not include the Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules.
    * Section 16(3) of the Commercial Courts Act only supersedes specific rules conflicting with the Act, not the entire body of the Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules.
    * Rule 265 of the Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules allows for condonation of delay and can be applied to commercial suits.
    * The Act does not specifically mention the Letters Patent and therefore, cannot override them by implication. 
    * The Act of 1987, which governs the Bombay High Court, has a non-obstante clause that would overrule the Commercial Courts Act.
    * The defendant's right to file a written statement is forfeited under Order VIII Rule 1, but not the court's discretion to accept a written statement under Order VIII Rule 9 and 10.
    * The Supreme Court's decision in Kailash vs. Nankhu established that Order VIII Rule 1 is directory, not mandatory, and the court has inherent powers to take a written statement on record, even after the statutory period.
    * Order VIII Rule 9 allows the court to require a written statement from any party at any time.
    * Order XV-A of the Commercial Courts Act further vests the court with powers to call for pleadings at any stage.
    * The court should consider equitable principles and emergent circumstances in allowing a belated written statement.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The court acknowledges the Supreme Court's decision in M/s SCG Contracts India Pvt. Ltd. Vs. K.S. Chamankar Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. (supra) which firmly establishes that the amended provisions of Order VIII Rule 1 (as introduced by the Commercial Courts Act) are mandatory.
    * The court distinguishes the Supreme Court's decision in Iridium India Telecom Ltd vs Motorola INC, finding that the Commercial Courts Act is a special law that overrides the Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules in case of conflict.
    * The court interprets the phrase "Rule of the jurisdictional High Court" in Section 16 of the Commercial Courts Act to include the Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules, thereby superseding them in case of conflict.
    * The court rejects the argument that the Act of 1987 overrides the Commercial Courts Act, finding that the Commercial Courts Act, being a later special law, prevails. 
    * The court rejects the argument that Order VIII Rule 9 grants the court discretion to take a written statement on record after the 120-day period. This interpretation would render the amendments to Order VIII Rule 1 and 10 otiose.
    * The court recognizes that the Supreme Court decision in Kailash vs. Nankhu was made in a different context (prior to the amendment by the Commercial Courts Act) and is not applicable to the present case. 
    * The court reaffirms the maxim dura lex sed lex, stating that equitable considerations cannot override the mandatory provisions of a statute.
    * The court clarifies that the period of 120 days starts from the date of service of summons, not the date of a defendant's appearance.
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The court meticulously analyzes the language and intent of the Commercial Courts Act, specifically focusing on the amended provisions of Order VIII Rule 1, 9, and 10, as well as Sections 16 and 21.
    * The court considers various precedents cited by both sides, including those interpreting the CPC prior to the amendments and those dealing with special laws.
    * The court applies the Mischief Rule, harmonious construction, and other principles of statutory interpretation to arrive at its conclusions.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The court applies the mandatory interpretation of the amended provisions of Order VIII Rule 1 to the facts of the case, concluding that a defendant cannot file a written statement after 120 days.
    * The court applies the principle of special law prevailing over general law, concluding that the Commercial Courts Act supersedes the Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules in case of conflict.
    * The court rejects the application of Order VIII Rule 9 and 10 to extend the time limit for filing a written statement. 
    * The court applies the principle of dura lex sed lex, rejecting the defendant's plea for equitable considerations to allow a belated written statement.

## 6. Judgment

* **Final Decision:** The court concludes that in Commercial Suits, a written statement by the defendant cannot be taken on record after the expiry of 120 days from the date of service of the Writ of Summons.
* **Relief Granted:**  The court grants no specific relief to either party, as this was a decision on a question of law.
* **Orders:** The court directs the Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of the Bombay High Court to follow the provisions of the CPC as amended by the Commercial Courts Act when adjudicating Commercial Suits.

## 7. Implications

* **Impact on Law:** This judgment clarifies the mandatory nature of the time limit for filing written statements in Commercial Suits and establishes the precedence for courts to apply the Commercial Courts Act consistently and uniformly. 
* **Future Relevance:** This judgment will likely influence future decisions in commercial suits across India, emphasizing the need for strict adherence to the timelines prescribed by the Commercial Courts Act.
* **Broader Context:** The judgment underscores the Indian government's efforts to improve the ease of doing business in the country and encourage foreign investment by streamlining commercial dispute resolution.

## 8. Summary Points

* The Commercial Courts Act, 2015, aims to expedite the resolution of commercial disputes by introducing strict timelines.
* The Act amended the CPC, including Order VIII Rule 1, which now mandates a 120-day limit for filing written statements in commercial suits.
* The Bombay High Court, despite being a Chartered High Court, is bound to apply the amended provisions of the CPC introduced by the Commercial Courts Act, even if they conflict with the Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules. 
* The court cannot exercise discretion to allow a written statement after the 120-day limit, even in exceptional circumstances.
* This judgment emphasizes the need for both plaintiffs and defendants to follow the timelines prescribed by the Commercial Courts Act.
