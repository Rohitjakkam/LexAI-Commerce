**Legal Doctrines:**

* **Vested Right:** The right to appeal is a substantive right that accrues to a party on the date the suit is instituted.
* **Res Judicata:**  The doctrine of res judicata prevents the same issue from being raised again once a final judgment has been made.
* **Waiver:**  A party may waive its right to insist on formal proof of a document by failing to raise a timely objection to its admissibility.
* **Interlocutory Orders:** Orders that do not finally determine the rights of the parties and can be addressed in an appeal against the final judgment.

## 4. Arguments Presented

**Plaintiff’s Argument:**

* The appeals are maintainable under Clause 15 of the Letters Patent because they were filed before the CCA was notified in Madras, and the plaintiff had a vested right to appeal under the Letters Patent.
* The appellant had a vested right to appeal under Clause 15 of the Letters Patent, as the "lis" commenced with the filing of the applications in August 2017. 
* Section 13 of the CCA does not apply to the case as the applications were filed before the notification of the Commercial Division.
* The appellant is entitled to mark the eschewed documents as secondary evidence, even though no application was filed under Section 65 of the Indian Evidence Act prior to marking them, because there is no requirement for such an application.
* The appellant should be allowed to file the affidavit of its Accounts Manager and Systems-in-charge under Section 65-B of the Indian Evidence Act because the Single Judge had not provided any reasons for dismissing this application.

**Defendant’s Argument:**

* The appeals are not maintainable under Clause 15 of the Letters Patent because the order passed by the Single Judge does not constitute a "judgment" as defined by the Letters Patent.
* The appeals are not maintainable under Section 13 of the CCA because the order under challenge is not an order specifically enumerated under Order XLIII of the CPC or Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.
* The appellant cannot claim ignorance of the requirement to seek permission before marking secondary evidence under Section 65 of the Indian Evidence Act and cannot be permitted to file an application for such permission after the documents were eschewed.
* The appellant had not specified the specific sub-clause of Section 65 of the Indian Evidence Act under which they were seeking to file secondary evidence, and they did not plead the specific circumstances required under Section 65(c).

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

**Key Findings:**

* The court found that the order passed by the Single Judge was an interlocutory order and not a "judgment" within the meaning of Clause 15 of the Letters Patent.
* The court held that the appeals are not maintainable under Section 13 of the CCA, as the order was passed by the Commercial Division of the High Court and the CCA specifically prohibits appeals against interlocutory orders of the Commercial Division.
* The court determined that the appellant's failure to file an application for leave to mark secondary evidence prior to marking the documents was a fatal flaw and that the order eschewing the documents was not a matter that could be revisited.

**Interpretation of Law:**

* The court interpreted Clause 15 of the Letters Patent to mean that an appeal lies only from a "judgment" and not from interlocutory orders.
* The court interpreted Section 13 of the CCA to mean that appeals against interlocutory orders of the Commercial Division are prohibited. 
* The court interpreted Section 65 of the Indian Evidence Act to require a party to seek permission before marking secondary evidence.

**Application of Law:**

* The court applied the principle of "vested right" to determine that the appellant's right to appeal accrued when the suit was instituted in February 2009, but this right was circumscribed by the subsequent enactment of the CCA. 
* The court applied the doctrine of res judicata to hold that the appellant could not revisit the order eschewing the documents.
* The court applied the principle of waiver to conclude that the appellant's failure to object to the admissibility of the documents at the time of marking them constituted a waiver of their right to insist on formal proof.

## 6. Judgment

**Final Decision:** 

* The court dismissed the Original Side Appeals (OSAs) as not maintainable.

**Relief Granted:** 

* No relief was granted to the appellant.

**Orders:**

* The appeals were dismissed.
* The connected C.M.Ps. were closed.

## 7. Implications

**Impact on Law:**

* This judgment reinforces the interpretation of Clause 15 of the Letters Patent and Section 13 of the CCA as restricting the appealability of interlocutory orders.
* The judgment confirms that a party cannot be permitted to mark documents as secondary evidence after they were eschewed for non-compliance with the Indian Evidence Act.

**Future Relevance:**

* This case serves as a reminder that parties must comply with procedural requirements for admitting evidence, such as seeking permission to mark secondary evidence, in a timely manner.
* The judgment may influence future decisions on the maintainability of appeals against interlocutory orders, particularly in cases involving the Commercial Division of High Courts.

**Broader Context:**

* This case highlights the importance of adhering to procedural rules in legal proceedings. 
* The judgment also underscores the potential implications of transferring cases to specialized courts, such as the Commercial Division, for parties' right to appeal.

## 8. Summary Points

* Appeals against interlocutory orders of the Commercial Division are generally not maintainable under the CCA.
* The right to appeal is a vested right that accrues on the date the suit is instituted, but subsequent enactments, such as the CCA, can take away this right.
* Failure to comply with procedural requirements for admitting evidence, such as seeking permission to mark secondary evidence, can result in the documents being eschewed.
* The doctrine of res judicata prevents parties from re-litigating issues that have already been decided by the court.
