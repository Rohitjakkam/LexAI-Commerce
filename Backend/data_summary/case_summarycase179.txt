    *  Section 24(5) of CPC empowers the High Court to transfer suits from courts lacking jurisdiction.
    *  The Commercial Court is subordinate to the High Court.
    *  The transfer would not violate Section 15 of the Commercial Courts Act.

    *  The suit was filed after the establishment of the Commercial Court at Vijayawada, which has jurisdiction over commercial disputes. 
    *  The Civil Court at Nellore lacks jurisdiction.
