## 4. Arguments Presented

•	**Plaintiff’s Argument:**
    * The plaintiff, the State of Gujarat, argued that the bar under Section 8 of the Commercial Courts Act does not apply to writ petitions under Article 227 of the Constitution. 
    * They asserted that Article 227 guarantees a constitutional right and cannot be curtailed by legislation.
    * The plaintiff further argued that the Commercial Court had wrongly refused to allow them to produce documents that were essential to prove their case, particularly the notification declaring the Kali river a "notified river."
    * They highlighted the importance of these documents, which were over 40 years old and crucial for the outcome of the suit.

•	**Defendant’s Argument:**
    * The defendant, the Union of India (represented by the railway authorities), argued that the petition under Article 227 was not maintainable because of the bar contained in Section 8 of the Commercial Courts Act.
    * They contended that the impugned order rejecting the application to produce documents was an interlocutory order, and the petition should be dismissed, leaving it open for the plaintiffs to raise this issue in an appeal against the final judgment. 
    * The defendant further argued that the plaintiffs had failed to produce the documents during the trial despite having a specific issue framed on the "notified river" status. 
    * They stated that Order VII Rule 14 of the CPC was not applicable to the Commercial Court and therefore, the plaintiffs were not entitled to rely on documents not initially produced.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

•	**Key Findings:**
    * The Court acknowledged the crucial nature of the documents sought to be produced by the plaintiffs, particularly the government notifications concerning the Kali river.
    * The Court found that the Commercial Court had erred in rejecting the application based solely on the non-applicability of Order VII Rule 14 of the CPC to commercial courts.
    * The Court recognized the importance of ensuring that all relevant documents are made available for the efficient resolution of disputes.

•	**Interpretation of Law:**
    * The Court meticulously examined Section 8 of the Commercial Courts Act and concluded that it does not explicitly bar writ petitions under Article 227 of the Constitution. 
    * The Court highlighted the wording of Section 8, which primarily addresses "civil revision application or petition" and not "writ petitions."
    * The Court also referred to previous Supreme Court judgments that underscored the importance of the High Courts' supervisory jurisdiction under Article 227 as an integral part of the basic structure of the Constitution.

•	**Application of Law:**
    * The Court applied the legal principles established in previous Supreme Court cases, emphasizing that the High Court's power of judicial superintendence cannot be curtailed by legislation.
    * The Court acknowledged that the bar under Section 8 of the Commercial Courts Act was designed to expedite commercial disputes. However, it also recognized that this bar should not be interpreted to completely negate the High Court's supervisory role under Article 227. 
    * Applying these principles, the Court concluded that the Commercial Court had wrongly restricted the plaintiffs' right to produce essential documents, potentially resulting in a miscarriage of justice.

## 6. Judgment

•	**Final Decision:** The Court granted the petition and quashed the impugned order of the Commercial Court. 

•	**Relief Granted:** The Court allowed the application filed by the plaintiffs and permitted them to produce the documents listed in Ex.72, subject to proving their authenticity and relevance according to the Indian Evidence Act and payment of costs.

•	**Orders:**

    * The High Court's power of superintendence under Article 227 of the Constitution cannot be curtailed by legislation, including the Commercial Courts Act.
