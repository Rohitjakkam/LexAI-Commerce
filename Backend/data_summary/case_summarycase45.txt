    * **Precedential Value:**  The court gave weight to past Supreme Court and High Court judgments relevant to the issues in the case.

## Arguments Presented

* **Appellants' Argument:** 
    * Argued that Section 10(3) and 15(2) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, clearly grant Commercial Courts exclusive jurisdiction over execution applications for commercial arbitral awards, even if the initial arbitral proceedings were not before a Commercial Court.
    * Relied on the Supreme Court's judgment in State of West Bengal vs. Associated Contractors to support the view that Section 42 of the Arbitration Act applies to execution applications.
    * Criticized the Commercial Court's reliance on the Sundaram Finance vs. Abdul Samad judgment, arguing that it was wrongly applied in this context. 
    * Cited several High Court judgments supporting the position that Commercial Courts have exclusive jurisdiction over commercial dispute arbitration proceedings.

* **Respondent's Argument:**
    * Argued that the Principal Civil Court (District and Sessions Judge) has the original jurisdiction to execute arbitral awards, as per the Arbitration Act and the Supreme Court's interpretation in State of Maharashtra vs. Atlanta Limited.
    * Contended that Section 15(2) of the Commercial Courts Act only mandates transferring cases pending in other courts to Commercial Courts, not giving exclusive jurisdiction for execution applications.
    * Supported the Commercial Court's reliance on the Sundaram Finance vs. Abdul Samad case, arguing that execution applications are not part of the original arbitral proceedings.
    * Also cited High Court judgments (e.g., Vijay Cotton vs. Agarwal Cotton Spinning) in support of their position.

## Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The court accepted the Supreme Court's finding in State of West Bengal vs. Associated Contractors that Section 42 of the Arbitration Act applies to applications made before, during, or after arbitral proceedings, including execution applications.
    * The court disagreed with the Chhattisgarh High Court's interpretation of Section 15(2) of the Commercial Courts Act, finding that it applies to all types of applications, including execution applications, under the Arbitration Act for commercial disputes.
    * The court concluded that the Sundaram Finance vs. Abdul Samad judgment was not directly applicable to the specific question of Commercial Court jurisdiction over execution applications, as it primarily concerned the territorial jurisdiction for execution.

* **Interpretation of Law:** 
    * The court analyzed Section 10(3) and 15(2) of the Commercial Courts Act to conclude that they explicitly transfer jurisdiction for commercial dispute arbitral proceedings, including execution applications, to Commercial Courts. 
    * The court interpreted "applications arising out of such arbitration" in Section 10(3) broadly to include execution applications under Section 36 of the Arbitration Act.

* **Application of Law:** 
    * The court applied the law to the specific facts of the case, concluding that the execution applications before the Commercial Court were for commercial disputes and therefore fell under the jurisdiction of the Commercial Court based on the Commercial Courts Act.

## Judgment

* **Final Decision:**
    * The appeals (CMA 12/2019 and CMA 5890/2018) were allowed, and the orders dismissing the execution applications by the Commercial Court were set aside.
    * The writ petition (WP 4379/2019) was dismissed.

* **Relief Granted:** 
    * The appellants in the appeals were granted the right to proceed with execution of the arbitral awards before the Commercial Courts.
    * The petitioner in the writ petition was denied relief.

* **Orders:**
    * The court directed the Commercial Courts to take jurisdiction over the execution applications.
    * The court dismissed all pending stay applications and interim applications.
