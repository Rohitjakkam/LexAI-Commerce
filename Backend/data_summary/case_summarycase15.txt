## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Appellant's Argument:**
    * The impugned order allowing new documents was a "judgment" in the broader sense, as defined by the Supreme Court in Shah Babulal Khimji v. Jayaben D. Kania & Another, and therefore appealable under Section 13(1) of the said Act.
    * The proviso to Section 13(1) was merely clarificatory and not intended to restrict the meaning of "judgment."
    * The non-obstante clause in Section 13(2) did not entirely eliminate the right of appeal under the Delhi High Court Act, 1966, and the appeal was maintainable under Section 10 of that Act.
    *  The "decision" in Section 13(1) was broad enough to encompass decrees, judgments, and orders.
    * The decision of the Bombay High Court in Hubtown Limited v. IDBI Trusteeship Services Limited supported their argument for a broader interpretation of Section 13.
* **Respondent's Argument:**
    * The impugned order was not an appealable order under Order XLIII of the CPC, as specifically stipulated by the proviso to Section 13(1) of the said Act.
    * Section 13(2) excluded the applicability of any other law, including the Delhi High Court Act, 1966, and the Letters Patent of the High Court.
    * The decision of the Delhi High Court in Harmanprit Singh Sidhu v. Arcadia Shares & Stock Brokers Pvt. Ltd supported their contention that appeals were limited to specifically enumerated orders.
    * The Statement of Objects and Reasons of the said Act indicated an intention to reduce the number of appeals from interlocutory orders in commercial disputes.
    * Section 21 of the said Act gave overriding effect to its provisions over conflicting provisions in other laws.
    * The Bombay High Court's decision in Hubtown Limited v. IDBI Trusteeship Services Limited did not lay down the correct law.

## 5. Court's Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The court recognized that the "said Act" was a special legislation aimed at streamlining the resolution of high-value commercial disputes, with an objective of promoting expeditious disposal and a positive image for the Indian legal system.
    * The court noted that the right of appeal is a statutory right and must be clearly established in the relevant legislation.
    * The court found that Section 16 of the "said Act" required the Commercial Division to apply the provisions of the CPC as amended by the Act.
    * The court emphasized the distinct nature of "decrees" and "orders" as defined in the CPC.
    * The court interpreted the proviso to Section 13(1) as limiting appealable orders to those specifically enumerated under Order XLIII of the CPC.
    * The court acknowledged the expansive nature of the non-obstante clause in Section 13(2) and its impact on the applicability of other laws, including the Delhi High Court Act, 1966.
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The court interpreted the "judgment" in Section 13(1) as referring to a decree, as the CPC only provided for appeals from decrees or orders.
    * The court strictly construed the proviso to Section 13(1), holding that it carved out an exception for appeals from orders not specifically enumerated in Order XLIII of the CPC.
    * The court held that the non-obstante clause in Section 13(2) effectively excluded the application of the Delhi High Court Act, 1966, and the Letters Patent of the High Court.
    * The court applied the principle of harmonious construction, finding that the interpretation given to the provisions of the "said Act" did not create any conflict between Sections 13 and 16.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The court applied the definitions of "decree," "judgment," and "order" under the CPC to interpret the provisions of Section 13.
    * The court applied the principle of statutory interpretation to determine the scope and effect of the proviso to Section 13(1) and the non-obstante clause in Section 13(2).
