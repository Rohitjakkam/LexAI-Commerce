* **Court:** Patna High Court
* **Date of Judgment:** 26th April 2023
* **Citation:** CWJC No.20350 of 2021

## 2. Background and Context

* **Brief Overview:** This case is a complex web of interrelated disputes arising from a Distribution Franchisee Agreement (DFA) signed in 2013 between SBPDCL (the distribution licensee), BEDCPL (the Special Purpose Vehicle, or SPV, created by the successful bidder), and SPML Infra Limited (the successful bidder). The disputes revolve around the validity of the arbitration proceeding, the proper parties to the arbitration agreement, the termination of the arbitral tribunal’s mandate, and the appointment/substitution of arbitrators. 
* **Key Issues:**
    * Whether SPML is a party to the arbitration agreement despite not being explicitly named in the arbitration clause.
    * Whether the BEDCPL, as an agent, has the right to initiate arbitration proceedings against SBPDCL, or if SPML should be the party.
    * Whether the extension of the arbitral tribunal’s mandate by the District Judge was valid after its mandate had already terminated.
    * Whether the Principal Civil Court had the jurisdiction to substitute arbitrators after the mandate of the tribunal had ended.
    * Whether a fresh arbitration proceeding should be initiated, considering the existing disputes and the lack of a functioning tribunal.

## 4. Arguments Presented

* **SBPDCL’s Argument:**
    * BEDCPL, being an agent of SPML, lacks the legal standing to initiate arbitration proceedings. 
    * There is no arbitration agreement between SBPDCL and BEDCPL, only between SBPDCL and SPML.
    * The arbitral tribunal's mandate expired on 13th May 2017, and its subsequent extension on oral consent was invalid.
    * The Principal Civil Court lacked the jurisdiction to extend the tribunal's mandate under Section 29A(4) of the Arbitration Act.
    * SBPDCL is entitled to appoint an arbitrator on behalf of SPML as per Section 11(6) of the Act. 
    * The BEDCPL's Request Case for substitution of arbitrators is fraudulent and not maintainable.
    * The earlier proceedings initiated by BEDCPL against SBPDCL cannot be revived.

* **SPML’s Argument:**
    * SPML is not a party to the arbitration agreement as per Clause 17.2 of the DFA.
    * The BEDCPL is the designated distribution franchisee, and SPML is only a confirming party. 
    * The issue of SPML being a party was already raised before the arbitral tribunal, and SBPDCL should have waited for its final adjudication.
    * SBPDCL has waived its right to object to the BEDCPL’s initiation of arbitration by participating in the proceedings.
    * The court’s extension of the tribunal's mandate was valid under Section 29A(4) of the Act.
    * SBPDCL cannot initiate a second arbitration proceeding while a previous one is ongoing.

* **BEDCPL’s Argument:**
    * BEDCPL, as a separate entity and a party to the DFA, has the right to initiate arbitration proceedings against SBPDCL.
    * The arbitral tribunal’s mandate was validly extended by consent of the parties under Section 29A(3) and by the court under Section 29A(4) of the Act.
    * SPML is not a party to the arbitration proceedings, and its appointment of an arbitrator is unnecessary.
    * The SBPDCL’s claims should be raised before the existing arbitral tribunal.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The court found that SPML is a party to the arbitration agreement despite not being explicitly named in the arbitration clause. The court considered the overall context of the DFA, including SPML's confirmation of the agreement, its undertaking to discharge BEDCPL's liabilities, and the intent of the parties as reflected in the RFP and LOI.
    * The court held that the Principal Civil Court lacked the jurisdiction to extend the mandate of the arbitral tribunal after its termination. This is because the power to extend the mandate is vested with the court that has the authority to appoint the arbitrators (in this case, the High Court).
    * The court recognized that the arbitral tribunal constituted in 2016 has ceased to exist due to the expiry of its mandate and the subsequent invalid extension.
    * The court acknowledged the prolonged dispute, noting that leaving the issue of SPML's party status to the arbitral tribunal would lead to further delays.

* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The court interpreted the terms "party" and "other party" in the arbitration clause of the DFA to encompass both BEDCPL and SPML. 
    * The court emphasized that the purpose of the Act is to ensure the timely resolution of disputes, and any ambiguities in its provisions should be interpreted liberally.
    * The court clarified the meaning of "extension" in Section 29A(4) to suggest that it applies only during the subsistence of the tribunal's mandate, not after its termination.

* **Application of Law:**
    * The court applied the principles of agency law, finding that BEDCPL's claim to initiate arbitration was untenable because SPML, the principal, was a party to the agreement and had undertaken liability.
    * The court applied the principle of statutory interpretation, considering the purpose of the legislation and the broader context of the dispute. 
    * The court emphasized the importance of avoiding conflicting jurisdiction between the High Court and the Principal Civil Court regarding the appointment and substitution of arbitrators. 

## 6. Judgment

* **Final Decision:**
    * The court allowed the SBPDCL’s petitions (CWJC No. 20350 of 2021, M.A. No. 635 of 2021, and M.A. No. 638 of 2021) to the extent that the order of the District Judge extending the mandate of the tribunal was set aside.
    * The court dismissed the remaining cases, concluding that the existing arbitration proceedings are no longer valid and need to be initiated afresh.

* **Relief Granted:**
    * The court ordered that a fresh arbitration proceeding be initiated. 
    * The court directed the parties to choose one arbitrator each (SBPDCL and SPML/BEDCPL) from a list of potential arbitrators provided by the court.
    * The two chosen arbitrators will nominate a presiding arbitrator.
    * The court instructed the parties to complete this process within two weeks of receiving the judgment.

* **Orders:**
    * The court ordered that the fresh arbitration proceeding be conducted under the provisions of Section 29A of the Arbitration Act. 
    * The court emphasized the need for the parties to ensure that SPML is not prejudiced in the new proceedings. 

## 7. Implications

* **Impact on Law:** 
    * The judgment provides a clear interpretation of the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act regarding the appointment, substitution, and extension of arbitrators, especially in the context of tripartite agreements.
    * It clarifies the scope of the Principal Civil Court's jurisdiction in relation to arbitration proceedings.

* **Future Relevance:**
    * The judgment could serve as a precedent in future cases involving disputes arising from tripartite agreements where the parties are not clearly defined in the arbitration clause.
    * The court's emphasis on ensuring fairness and avoiding conflicting jurisdiction could influence future decisions regarding the appointment and substitution of arbitrators. 

* **Broader Context:**
    * The case highlights the complexity and potential delays that can arise from disputes involving multiple parties and overlapping legal issues.
    * The court's decision to order a fresh arbitration proceeding underscores the importance of resolving disputes fairly and efficiently.

## 8. Summary Points

* SBPDCL successfully challenged the validity of the previous arbitration proceedings due to the invalid extension of the tribunal’s mandate.
* The court held that SPML is a party to the arbitration agreement despite not being explicitly named in the arbitration clause.
* The Principal Civil Court lacks jurisdiction to extend the mandate of the tribunal after its termination. 
* The court ordered a fresh arbitration proceeding with a new tribunal, requiring the parties to appoint one arbitrator each.
