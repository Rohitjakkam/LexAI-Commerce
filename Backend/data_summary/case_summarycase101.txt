##  5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:** 
    * The court examined the definition of "commercial dispute" in Section 2(1)(c) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 and found that it encompassed disputes arising from agreements relating to immovable property used in trade or commerce.

    * The court considered the nature of the relationship between defendant No. 3 and defendant No. 7 (banker) and accepted that the mortgage was a regular banking transaction.
