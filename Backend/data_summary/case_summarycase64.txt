## 1. Case Title

* **Case Name:** Prime Cottex Pvt. Ltd. vs. Bank of Baroda
* **Court:** Gujarat High Court
* **Date of Judgment:** 18th December 2019
* **Citation:** C/FA/5349/2019

## 2. Background and Context

**Brief Overview:** Prime Cottex Pvt. Ltd. (Appellant), a company engaged in cotton ginning and pressing, acted as a corporate guarantor for M/s. ABC Cotspin Pvt. Ltd. (Borrower) for loans sanctioned by Bank of Baroda (Respondent). The Bank agreed to release Prime Cottex's guarantee upon the Borrower providing new collateral and Prime Cottex releasing its existing collateral. Prime Cottex fulfilled its obligations, but the Bank did not release the guarantee. Despite this, the Bank filed a recovery application before the Debts Recovery Tribunal (DRT) against both the Borrower and Prime Cottex. The DRT ruled in favor of the Bank, holding Prime Cottex liable as a guarantor. 

**Key Issues:**

* Whether the Commercial Court had jurisdiction to entertain Prime Cottex's suit against the Bank, seeking a declaration that it was discharged from the guarantee.
* Whether the Commercial Court's decision to reject the plaint on grounds of *res judicata* and the bar of jurisdiction under the Recovery of Debts and Bankruptcy Act, 1993 (the Act, 1993) was justified.

## 4. Arguments Presented

**Plaintiff’s Argument (Prime Cottex):**

* Prime Cottex argued that it had fulfilled its obligations under the sanction letter by providing new collateral and releasing its existing collateral.
* The Bank's failure to release the guarantee constituted a breach of contract.
* The suit was an independent claim based on the breach of contract, and not a counterclaim to the Bank's DRT application. 
* The DRT's decision was not *res judicata* as the issues before the DRT and the civil court were distinct.
* The Act, 1993 barred the Civil Court's jurisdiction only regarding applications for debt recovery by banks, not independent suits filed by guarantors.
* The Commercial Court had jurisdiction to entertain Prime Cottex's suit seeking a declaration of its discharge from the guarantee.

**Defendant’s Argument (Bank of Baroda):**

* The Bank argued that Prime Cottex's suit was frivolous and aimed at escaping its obligations as a guarantor.
* The DRT had already decided the issue of the guarantee and found Prime Cottex liable.
* Prime Cottex should have filed a counterclaim within the DRT proceedings instead of filing a separate suit.
* The Commercial Court's jurisdiction was barred under Section 17 of the Act, 1993, as the matter fell within the DRT's purview.
* The suit was barred by *res judicata* due to the DRT's decision.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

**Key Findings:**

* The Court found that the Commercial Court had erred in rejecting the plaint. 
* The Commercial Court had not properly considered the averments in the plaint when determining if the suit was barred by law. 
* The Court determined that the DRT's decision was not *res judicata* in the context of Prime Cottex's independent suit. 
* The Court clarified that the Act, 1993 barred the Civil Court's jurisdiction only for debt recovery applications by banks, not for independent suits filed by borrowers or guarantors.

**Interpretation of Law:**

* The Court emphasized the limited scope of Order VII Rule 11(d) and the need for specific findings regarding the bar of a suit.
* The Court carefully analyzed the relevant statutory provisions, particularly Section 17 and Section 18 of the Act, 1993, to ascertain the scope of the DRT's jurisdiction.
* The Court interpreted the precedents cited, such as *Nahar Industrial Enterprises Ltd.* and *Indian Bank Vs. ABS Marine Products*, to support its conclusion that the Civil Court's jurisdiction was not barred in this case.

**Application of Law:**

* The Court applied the principle of *res judicata* with caution, recognizing that the DRT's decision did not necessarily bar Prime Cottex's independent claim.
* The Court distinguished the issues in Prime Cottex's suit from those before the DRT, finding no direct and substantial overlap.
* The Court found no basis for applying the *res judicata* principle to preclude Prime Cottex from seeking a declaration of its discharge.

## 6. Judgment

**Final Decision:** The appeal was allowed. The Gujarat High Court quashed and set aside the Commercial Court's order rejecting the plaint.

**Relief Granted:** The Commercial Suit No. 10 of 2018 was ordered to be restored to the Commercial Court for further proceedings.
