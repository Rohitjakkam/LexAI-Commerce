## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Appellant's Argument:**
    * The Respondent's counter-claim was filed beyond the three-year limitation period prescribed by the Limitation Act.
    * The time spent by the Respondent in pursuing its application under Section 8 of the A&C Act should not be excluded from the limitation period.
    * The legal notices issued by the Respondent did not constitute notices invoking arbitration under Section 21 of the A&C Act.
* **Respondent's Argument:**
    * The Respondent is entitled to exclude the time spent on the Section 8 application under Section 14 of the Limitation Act.
    * The legal notices issued by the Respondent can be considered as notices invoking arbitration, stopping the limitation period from running. 
    * The counter-claim was filed within the three-year limitation period, taking into account the excluded time.

## 5. Courtâ€™s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The court rejected the Respondent's argument that it was entitled to exclude the time spent on the Section 8 application under Section 14 of the Limitation Act. The court held that Section 14 applies to plaintiffs, not defendants, and the Respondent's application under Section 8 did not constitute a civil proceeding relating to the same matter in issue as the counter-claim.
    * The court found that the legal notices issued by the Respondent did not meet the requirements of Section 21 of the A&C Act, as they did not contain a request for the disputes to be referred to arbitration.
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The court interpreted Section 14 of the Limitation Act strictly, emphasizing that it applies only to plaintiffs diligently pursuing their claims in a court lacking jurisdiction. 
    * The court clarified that an application under Section 8 of the A&C Act is not equivalent to a notice invoking arbitration under Section 21 of the A&C Act.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The court applied the legal principles of limitation period, exclusion of time, and commencement of arbitral proceedings to determine the validity of the Respondent's counter-claim. 
    * The court analyzed the specific content of the legal notices issued by the Respondent to determine whether they constituted notices invoking arbitration.

## 6. Judgment

* **Final Decision:** The appeal was allowed. The impugned award (by the Arbitral Tribunal) and the impugned order (by the Commercial Court) were set aside.
* **Relief Granted:** The Respondent's counter-claim was deemed barred by limitation, meaning it was rejected.
* **Orders:** The parties were ordered to bear their own costs.

## 7. Implications

* **Impact on Law:** The judgment clarifies that Section 14 of the Limitation Act does not apply to defendants seeking to exclude time spent on applications under Section 8 of the A&C Act. It further clarifies that a simple legal notice does not automatically constitute a notice invoking arbitration under Section 21 of the A&C Act.
* **Future Relevance:** This case will serve as a precedent for future cases involving similar situations, especially in relation to the applicability of Section 14 of the Limitation Act in the context of counter-claims.
* **Broader Context:** This case highlights the importance of correctly identifying the relevant legal provisions and accurately interpreting the legal principles governing limitation periods, commencement of arbitral proceedings, and notices invoking arbitration.

## 8. Summary Points

* The court found that the legal notices issued by the Respondent did not meet the requirements of Section 21 of the A&C Act, as they did not contain a request for the disputes to be referred to arbitration.
* The court ultimately dismissed the Respondent's counter-claim as being barred by limitation.
