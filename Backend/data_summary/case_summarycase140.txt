## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Plaintiff’s Argument (DTTDC):**
    *  The counterclaim filed by Swadeshi was belated and without justification.
    *  The counterclaim was beyond the scope of the original reference to arbitration as stipulated by Clause 25 of the General Conditions of Contract (GCC).
    *  The appointment of the Arbitrator by the High Court under Section 14(2) of the Arbitration Act did not expand the scope of reference.
    *  Swadeshi had the opportunity to raise counterclaims in the High Court petition but failed to do so.
    *  The counterclaim was submitted without following the procedure outlined in Clause 25 of the GCC, which required a specific reference by the Appointing Authority.
* **Defendant’s Argument (Swadeshi):**
    *  The counterclaims were filed within the time limit and were not barred by limitation.
    *  The counterclaims were within the scope of the arbitration agreement as they related to the subject matter of the dispute.
    *  The High Court's appointment of the Arbitrator under Section 11 of the Arbitration Act, coupled with the absence of specific reference to the disputes, implied a general reference to all disputes between the parties.
    *  The Arbitrator had the jurisdiction to entertain counterclaims based on the Supreme Court's judgment in the State of Goa vs. M/s Praveen Enterprises case.
    *  The Arbitrator's decision to dismiss the counterclaims was arbitrary and against the principles of natural justice.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The court acknowledged that Clause 25 of the GCC specifically required disputes to be referred to the Arbitrator by the Appointing Authority.
    * The court found that the High Court's order appointing the Arbitrator under Section 14(2) did not expand the scope of reference beyond the disputes that were originally referred to the initial Arbitrator, Mr. O.P. Bhatia.
    * The court recognized that the parties had the option of raising counterclaims in the High Court petition but did not do so.
    * The court considered the Supreme Court's judgment in the State of Goa vs. M/s Praveen Enterprises case, concluding that it was applicable when the arbitration agreement contained specific references to the disputes.
    * The court agreed with the Arbitrator's decision to dismiss the counterclaims due to their belated filing and lack of specific reference by the Appointing Authority.
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The court interpreted the relevant provisions of the Arbitration Act, specifically Section 11, 14, and 23(2A), in conjunction with the specific terms of the GCC.
    * The court analyzed the precedents cited by both parties, applying their rationale to the present case.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The court applied the principle of jurisdiction, finding that the Arbitrator's authority was limited by the specific reference of the original disputes.
    * The court considered the principle of natural justice, concluding that the Arbitrator had acted fairly and impartially in dismissing the counterclaims.
    * The court applied the principle of public policy, determining that the Arbitrator's decision was not against any fundamental policy of Indian law.
