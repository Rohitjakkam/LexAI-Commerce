    * The Court found that the dispute was indeed a commercial dispute based on the original value of the suit, which exceeded the specified threshold for commercial disputes under the Act.
    * The Court also found that the partial payment did not change the fundamental nature of the dispute as a commercial one.
* **Interpretation of Law:**
