## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Appellant's Argument:**
    * The Arbitral Tribunal granted relief exceeding the Respondent's claim, demonstrating patent illegality.
    * The Respondent did not provide sufficient evidence to support its claim, and the onus should have shifted to the Appellant.
    * The Appellant made a clear admission in its claim petition regarding payment of INR 5,70,00,000/- to the Respondent, which the Arbitral Tribunal disregarded.
    * The Arbitral Tribunal's non-disposal of the Appellant's application for discovery of the Respondent's books and accounts resulted in a miscarriage of justice.
    * The Appellant should be allowed to raise new legal arguments at the appellate stage, as they go to the root of the matter.
* **Respondent's Argument:**
    * The scope of interference under Section 34 of the Act is limited and does not permit re-hearing of the case.
    * There are contradictions and inconsistencies in the Appellant's statements, making them unreliable.
    * The non-disposal of the discovery application was a minor irregularity and did not prejudice the Appellant.
    * The Appellant's admission in cross-examination regarding payment of INR 5,02,00,000/- to the Respondent must be considered, and it should be held liable for the remaining amount.
