## 1. Case Title

* **Case Name:** M/s Shree Ram Junawa Industries vs. M/s Rounak Steels
* **Court:** Rajasthan High Court - Jodhpur
* **Date of Judgment:** 18th October 2022
* **Citation:** S.B. Civil Writ Petition No. 8048/2022

## 2. Background and Context

* **Brief Overview:**  M/s Shree Ram Junawa Industries (petitioner) purchased goods from M/s Rounak Steels (respondent) but failed to make timely payment. The respondent filed a complaint with the Micro and Small Enterprises Facilitation Council (MSEFC) under the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006 (MSMED Act). The MSEFC issued an award directing the petitioner to pay the amount due. The petitioner challenged this award before the Rajasthan High Court, but the petition was dismissed. Subsequently, the petitioner filed an appeal under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (Arbitration Act) in the Commercial Court and was directed to deposit 75% of the award amount. The petitioner failed to deposit the amount and the appeal was dismissed. The respondent then initiated execution proceedings. The petitioner filed objections under Section 47 of the CPC, which were rejected by the Commercial Court. The petitioner then filed this writ petition challenging the order rejecting the objections.

* **Key Issues:** 
    * Validity of the MSEFC award: Was the award passed in violation of Section 10 of the Arbitration Act due to the death of one of the members of the Arbitration Tribunal?
    * Premature execution proceedings: Were the execution proceedings initiated before the expiry of the time limit for challenging the award under the Arbitration Act?
    * Stamp duty on the award: Was the award required to be stamped under the Rajasthan Stamp Act?
