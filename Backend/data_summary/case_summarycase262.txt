	•	Court: Tripura High Court
	•	Date of Judgment: 9th October 2023
	•	Citation:  IA 03 OF 2023 IN ARB. A. 04 OF 2023

## 2. Background and Context

	•	**Brief Overview:** The State of Tripura (Applicant/Appellant) entered into an agreement with Damni (Respondent/Contractor) for the construction of two RCC bridges in 2007. The contract was later rescinded due to delays in starting the work by Damni. Damni invoked arbitration proceedings, which ruled in his favor. The State of Tripura appealed this decision in a Commercial Court, but the appeal was dismissed due to a limitation period. This dismissal was further appealed to the High Court and ultimately withdrawn with the liberty to file fresh proceedings. The State of Tripura filed a review application with the Commercial Court, which was also dismissed. The present case involves the State of Tripura's attempt to appeal the dismissal of the review application.
	•	**Key Issues:**
		* Whether the State of Tripura's appeal was barred by limitation.
