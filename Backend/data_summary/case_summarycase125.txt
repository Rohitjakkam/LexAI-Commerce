## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Plaintiff’s Argument:**
    * The Plaintiff, Bharat Bhogilal Patel, argued that the amendments to the CPC introduced by the Commercial Courts Act only apply to commercial disputes of a Specified Value.
    * The Plaintiff emphasized that the Specified Value of the suit was ₹20,000, which falls below the threshold set by the Act.
    * The Plaintiff claimed that the 120-day time limit for filing a Written Statement should not be applicable in this case as the suit was below the Specified Value.
    * The Plaintiff argued that the plain and unambiguous language of Section 16 of the Commercial Courts Act makes it clear that the amendments only apply to cases exceeding the Specified Value.
* **Defendant’s Argument:**
    * The Defendant, Leitz Tooling Systems India Pvt. Ltd., argued that the amendments to the CPC introduced by the Commercial Courts Act apply to all commercial disputes, regardless of value.
    * The Defendant emphasized that the Commercial Courts Act was intended to expedite all commercial disputes, including those falling under the first proviso of Section 7, which covered Intellectual Property Rights matters.
    * The Defendant contended that applying different procedural rules based on the value of the dispute would create a chaotic and inefficient system, defeating the purpose of the Act.
    * The Defendant argued that interpreting Section 16 literally would lead to an absurd situation where matters heard by the Commercial Division would be governed by different rules depending on their value, even though they were being adjudicated by the same forum under the same Act.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The court acknowledged that the language of Section 16, in its literal interpretation, seemed to limit the application of the amendments to commercial disputes of a Specified Value.
    * The court recognized that the marginal note/heading to Section 16 and the Schedule to the Act referred to "commercial disputes" generally, which could be interpreted to include all commercial disputes, not just those above the Specified Value. 
    * The court also considered the potential for an absurd outcome if the amendments were not applied to all commercial disputes, even those below the Specified Value.
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The court relied heavily on the literal rule of interpretation, stating that where the words of a statute are clear and unambiguous, courts should adhere to that meaning.
    * The court found that the language of Section 16 was sufficiently clear to warrant a literal interpretation.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The court applied the literal rule of interpretation to Section 16 and concluded that the amendments introduced to the CPC by the Commercial Courts Act only apply to commercial disputes of a Specified Value.
    * The court determined that the 120-day period for filing a Written Statement mandated by the Commercial Courts Act would not apply to commercial disputes not exceeding the Specified Value.

## 6. Judgment

* **Final Decision:** The court ruled in favor of the Defendant, Leitz Tooling Systems India Pvt. Ltd., finding that the amendments introduced to the CPC by the Commercial Courts Act do not apply to commercial disputes below the Specified Value.
* **Relief Granted:** The court condoned the delay of two days in filing the Written Statement in the suit and disposed of the Notice of Motion.
* **Orders:** The court concluded that the question of law had been decided, and the delay in filing the Written Statement in the suit was condoned.

## 7. Implications

The case underscores the need for clarity and consistency in applying the Act's provisions to ensure its intended objectives are met.
