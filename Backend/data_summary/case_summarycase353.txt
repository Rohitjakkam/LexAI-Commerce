The first petition challenged an order dismissing SHAJ's application to terminate the mandate of an Arbitral Tribunal as infructuous due to the publication of the award. The second petition challenged an order requiring SHAJ to pay 75% of the awarded amount to admit a case under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.
* **Key Issues:** The central issue was whether the High Court, specifically a Single Judge, had jurisdiction to hear petitions under Article 227 of the Constitution of India challenging orders passed by the Commercial Court in Ranchi, given the establishment of the Commercial Appellate Division under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015.

**4. Arguments Presented**

* **Plaintiff’s Argument (SHAJ):** SHAJ argued that the orders passed by the Commercial Court were incorrect and should be quashed. They contended that the Commercial Appellate Division, as established by the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, was the appropriate forum to hear challenges against the Commercial Court's orders, and not a Single Judge of the High Court.
* **Defendant’s Argument (RCM Infrastructure Limited):** RCM Infrastructure Limited argued that the petitions filed under Article 227 of the Constitution were maintainable before a Single Judge of the High Court, as the Commercial Appellate Division was only empowered to hear appeals, not petitions under Article 227. They cited the Delhi High Court judgment in "Delhi Tourism and Transportation Development Corporation vs. Swadeshi Civil Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd."  to support their argument.

**5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning**

* **Key Findings:**
    * The Court recognized that the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 created a specialized system for resolving commercial disputes, including the establishment of the Commercial Appellate Division.
    * The Court acknowledged the existence of the Coordinate Bench's judgment in "M/s Deepak Printers & Publishers" (supra) which held that the Commercial Appellate Division should hear all challenges against Commercial Courts, including those under Article 227.
    * The Court also recognized the Supreme Court's precedents emphasizing the supervisory jurisdiction of High Courts under Article 227, which could not be curtailed by statutes.
* **Interpretation of Law:** The Court carefully analyzed the provisions of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, focusing on the establishment and powers of the Commercial Appellate Division.  It also scrutinized Article 227 of the Constitution and its interpretation by the Supreme Court in previous cases.
* **Application of Law:** The Court applied the legal principles to the specific facts of the case. It considered whether the Commercial Appellate Division, created by statute, could supersede the High Court's inherent power of superintendence under Article 227.

**6. Judgment**

* **Final Decision:** The Court did not reach a final decision on the merits of the case. Instead, it refrained from exercising jurisdiction due to the conflicting interpretation of the law, particularly regarding the interplay between Article 227 and the Commercial Courts Act, 2015.
* **Relief Granted:** No relief was granted as the Court did not adjudicate the merits of the case.
* **Orders:** The Court ordered the Registry to place the cases before the Hon'ble Chief Justice for assignment to the Division Bench of the High Court. The Court formulated a specific question for the Division Bench to answer: "Whether or not a petition filed under Article 227 of the Constitution of India will lie in the jurisdiction of the Commercial Appellate Division of this Court which has been constituted to hear appeals under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015?"

**7. Implications**

* **Impact on Law:** The judgment did not directly impact existing law but highlighted the complex legal issues arising from the interaction of different legal provisions, particularly Article 227 and the Commercial Courts Act, 2015.
* **Future Relevance:** The Division Bench's decision on the question formulated by the Single Judge will have significant implications for future cases involving petitions under Article 227 in the context of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015.
* **Broader Context:** The case underscores the importance of clear legal frameworks and the need for consistent interpretation of laws to avoid conflicting jurisdictions and potential confusion in legal proceedings.

**8. Summary Points**

* The State Highways Authority of Jharkhand challenged orders passed by the Commercial Court in Ranchi through petitions under Article 227.
* The main issue was the jurisdictional conflict between the High Court's power of superintendence under Article 227 and the Commercial Appellate Division established under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015.
* The Single Judge refrained from deciding the case, referring it to the Division Bench for a definitive resolution on the jurisdiction issue.
