## 2. Background and Context

* **Brief Overview:** Arunkumar Jagatramka (the petitioner/judgment debtor) filed this petition to challenge an order of the executing court under Order XXI, Rule 37 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (CPC). This order required him to show cause as to why he should not be committed to civil prison for failing to pay a debt to Ultrabulk A/S (the respondent/decree holder), a Danish company.

    * Whether the executing court should have decided the petitioner's application challenging its jurisdiction before proceeding with the show-cause notice.

## 4. Arguments Presented

    * The executing court prejudged the issue by recording premature and prejudicial findings of fact in the impugned order.
    * The court failed to comply with the requirements of Section 51 and Order XXI, Rule 40, CPC by failing to provide a proper opportunity for the petitioner to be heard before issuing the show-cause notice.
