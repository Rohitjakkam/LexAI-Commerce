They denied the appellant's allegations regarding incomplete project and delayed completion.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

    * The 'specified value' of the dispute exceeded one crore, making it a commercial dispute under the Act, 2015.
* **Interpretation of Law:** The Court interpreted the definition of "commercial dispute" under Section 2(1)(c)(vii) of the Act, 2015, and found that it covered agreements relating to immovable property used exclusively in trade or commerce.
* **Application of Law:** The Court applied the provisions of Section 10 read with Section 12 of the Act, 2015, which determined the jurisdiction of Commercial Courts in cases involving commercial disputes exceeding one crore.

## 6. Judgment
