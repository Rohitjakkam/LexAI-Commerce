## Arguments Presented

* **Plaintiff's Argument (Madhan Raj and Niranjani):**
    * The transactions with Radha Ramalingam were commercial in nature as they involved money lending and borrowing, and the execution of promissory notes.
    * They were licensed money lenders, making the transactions qualify under Section 2(1)(c)(i) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015.
    * The pre-institution mediation requirement under Section 12(a) is procedural and curable even during pending suits. 
    * The lower court's decision to allow the amendment of the plaint and condone the delay in filing the statement of truth was justified.
* **Defendant's Argument (Radha Ramalingam):**
    * The suits were not maintainable under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 as the transactions were ordinary money lending and not "commercial disputes".
    * The plaintiff failed to comply with the mandatory pre-institution mediation requirement under Section 12(a) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015.
    * The lower court's dismissal of the application to reject the plaint under Order 7 Rule 11 was a cryptic order without reasoning, exhibiting non-application of mind.
    * The amendment of the plaint was improper, introducing a new cause of action, and the delay in filing the statement of truth was not justified.

## Court's Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The Court reviewed the judgments cited by both parties and analyzed the definition of "commercial dispute" under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015. 
    * The Court emphasized the importance of reasoned orders and concluded that the lower court's dismissal of the application to reject the plaint in C.O.S. No. 9 of 2022 was a cryptic and unsustainable order.
    * While acknowledging the procedural nature of the pre-institution mediation requirement, the Court highlighted the mandatory nature of Section 12(a) as emphasized by the Supreme Court in the case of *Patil Automation Pvt., Ltd., & others Vs. Rakheja Engineers Pvt., Ltd.*, (2022) 10 Supreme Court Cases 1.
* **Interpretation of Law:** 
    * The Court interpreted the definition of "commercial dispute" narrowly, concluding that merely lending money, without a clear nexus to a commercial or business activity, does not automatically qualify as a commercial dispute. 
    * The Court emphasized the importance of adhering to the mandatory provisions of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, including the pre-institution mediation requirement. 
* **Application of Law:**
    * The Court applied the law to the facts of the case, concluding that the suits filed by Madhan Raj and Niranjani were not maintainable under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, due to the lack of evidence of commercial transactions.
    * The Court found that the lower court's orders allowing the amendment of the plaint and condoning the delay in the statement of truth were not sustainable.
    * The Court exercised its superintending power to rectify the procedural irregularities committed by the lower court. 

## Judgment

* **Final Decision:** 
    * The Court allowed the revision petitions filed by Radha Ramalingam (C.R.P. Nos. 3672, 3800 of 2022, and 2123 of 2023) and dismissed the revision petition filed by Madhan Raj (C.R.P. No. 338 of 2023). 
* **Relief Granted:** 
    * The Court set aside the lower court's order dismissing the application to reject the plaint in C.O.S. No. 9 of 2022.
    * The Court set aside the order allowing the amendment of the plaint in C.O.S. No. 9 of 2022.
    * The Court struck off the plaint in C.O.S. No. 10 of 2023 filed by Niranjani, due to the failure to comply with the mandatory pre-institution mediation requirement. 
* **Orders:** 
    * The Court directed the lower court to reconsider the maintainability of the suits filed by Madhan Raj and Niranjani in light of the Court's findings.
    * The Court left open to the parties to work out their remedies available under the Act, as held and directed by the Hon'ble Apex Court.
