## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Appellant’s Argument:**
    * **Jurisdiction:** The appellant argued that the dispute was governed by the Maharashtra Rent Control Act, 1999, and that the Civil Court, not the Commercial Court, had jurisdiction. They cited Section 47 of the Act, which bars injunctions and designates the competent authority under Section 49 as the sole decision-maker.
    * **Maintainability of Suit:** The appellant argued that the suit was barred by limitation as the cause of action arose in April 2016, and the respondent filed the suit in 2019.
    * **Interim Injunction:** The appellant argued that the interim mandatory injunction was tantamount to granting final relief, as it was not intended to maintain the status quo but to give possession to the respondent. They contended that granting such relief before framing issues and hearing evidence was inappropriate. They also argued that the Commercial Court failed to comply with Section 12-A of the Commercial Courts Act regarding mandatory pre-institution mediation. 
* **Respondent’s Argument:**
    * **Jurisdiction:** The respondent argued that the Commercial Court had jurisdiction as the dispute was a commercial one, given the nature of the leave and license agreement and the appellant's status as a private limited company with share capital exceeding Rs. 2 Crores. They also claimed that the appellant's objection regarding jurisdiction was waived as it was not raised before the trial court. 
    * **Maintainability of Suit:** The respondent argued that the suit was not barred by limitation, as it was not a suit for mandatory injunction but for possession.
    * **Interim Injunction:** The respondent argued that the interim mandatory injunction was justified as the appellant was in illegal occupation of the premises, had not paid rent for a long time, and was earning profits while the respondent was deprived of their rightful income.
