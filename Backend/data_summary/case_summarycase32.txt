## 1. Case Title

* **Case Name:** Jaycee Housing Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. vs Registrar (General), Orissa High Court, Cuttack & Ors. 
* **Court:** Supreme Court of India
* **Date of Judgment:** 19th October 2022
* **Citation:**  Civil Appeal No. 6876 of 2022 (with CA No. 6878/2022 and CA No. 6877/2022) 

## 2. Background and Context

* **Brief Overview:** The appellants, Jaycee Housing Pvt. Ltd. and others, challenged a notification issued by the State of Odisha establishing the Court of Civil Judge (Senior Division) as Commercial Courts to exercise jurisdiction under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 (Act, 2015). This challenge arose because the appellants' arbitration proceedings, initially filed in the District Judge's court, were transferred to the newly designated Commercial Court. The appellants argued that this transfer violated Section 2(1)(e) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (Arbitration Act, 1996), which, they claimed, reserved such jurisdiction for the Principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction in a district. 
* **Key Issues:** 
    * Whether the designation of the Court of Civil Judge (Senior Division) as a Commercial Court under the Act, 2015, conflicts with Section 2(1)(e) of the Arbitration Act, 1996.
    * Whether the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, being a later enactment, overrides the provisions of the Arbitration Act, 1996, in case of conflict. 

## 3. Legal Principles Involved

* **Relevant Statutes and Provisions:**
    * **Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (Act, 1996):**
        * Section 2(1)(e): Defines "Court" in the context of arbitration, specifying the jurisdiction of the Principal Civil Court and excluding inferior courts.
    * **Commercial Courts Act, 2015 (Act, 2015):**
        * Section 3: Empowers the State Government to establish Commercial Courts.
        * Section 10: Defines the jurisdiction of Commercial Courts in relation to arbitration matters, including applications and appeals.
        * Section 15: Provides for transfer of pending cases to Commercial Courts.
        * Section 21: States that the Act, 2015 has overriding effect over other laws, except as otherwise provided. 
* **Precedents Cited:**
    * **State of Maharashtra and Anr. Vs. Atlanata Ltd.; (2014) 11 SCC 619:**  Addresses the supervisory role of courts in arbitration proceedings.
    * **State of West Bengal and Ors. Vs. Associated Contractors; (2015) 1 SCC 32:**  Also deals with the supervisory role of courts in arbitration proceedings.
    * **Fuerst Day Lawson Ltd. Vs. Jindal Exports Ltd.; (2011) 8 SCC 333:**  Highlights the self-contained and exhaustive nature of the Arbitration Act.
    * **Kandla Export Corporation and Anr. Vs. OCI Corporation and Anr.; (2018) 14 SCC 715:**  Confirms the precedence of the Arbitration Act over other laws in case of conflict.
    * **BGS SGS SOMA JV Vs. NHPC Ltd.; (2020) 4 SCC 234:**  Reaffirms the principle of the Arbitration Act being a complete code and a special Act.

    * **Interpretation of Statutes:** The court's approach to interpreting the relevant statutory provisions and resolving inconsistencies.
    * **Legislative Intent:** The court's consideration of the purpose and intent of the legislature in enacting the relevant statutes. 

## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Appellants' Argument:**
    * Section 2(1)(e) of the Arbitration Act, 1996, explicitly restricts the jurisdiction over arbitration matters to the Principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction in a district, excluding any inferior court.
    * The designation of the Court of Civil Judge (Senior Division) as a Commercial Court to handle arbitration matters violates this restriction.
    * The Arbitration Act, 1996, being a special statute, prevails over the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, in case of conflict, as established by precedents.
    * Conferring jurisdiction on a subordinate court creates unnecessary delays and challenges to the High Court, defeating the purpose of speedy disposal in arbitration proceedings.
* **Respondent's Argument:**
    * The Commercial Courts Act, 2015, is a later enactment specifically aimed at expediting commercial disputes, including arbitration proceedings.
    * Section 10 of the Act, 2015, explicitly provides for Commercial Courts to handle applications and appeals arising from arbitration matters, superseding any conflicting provisions in the Arbitration Act, 1996.
    * The establishment of Commercial Courts promotes efficiency and reduces the workload on the Principal Civil Courts.
    * Interpreting Section 2(1)(e) of the Arbitration Act, 1996, to exclude Commercial Courts would render Section 10 of the Act, 2015, redundant and violate the principle of statutory interpretation. 

## 5. Courtâ€™s Analysis and Reasoning

    * The court emphasizes the legislative intent behind the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, in expediting commercial disputes, and deems it crucial to uphold this intent.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The court applies the principle of special statute vs. general law, finding that the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, being a later and more specific enactment, overrides the conflicting provisions of the Arbitration Act, 1996. 
    * The court applies the principle of statutory interpretation, considering the purpose and intent of the legislature in enacting the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, and ensuring that its provisions are not rendered nugatory.
