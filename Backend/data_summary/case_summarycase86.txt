## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Plaintiff’s Argument (Appellants):**
    * They are joint owners of the software programs, including CATIA, and they keep track of all licensed users.
    * Appellant no. 1 (parent company) operates in India through appellant no. 2 (subsidiary), which gives the Delhi High Court territorial jurisdiction.
    * The plaint clearly indicates their claim of joint ownership and the need for an injunction against unauthorized use of the software.
* **Defendant’s Argument (Respondents):**
    * The Delhi High Court lacks jurisdiction because the respondent's principal office is in Goa, and its directors do not reside in Delhi.
    * Appellant no. 2 cannot claim copyright in CATIA because the copyright is registered in the name of appellant no. 1, and no valid assignment of copyright has been made to the subsidiary.
    * The plaint should be read as a whole and does not establish a strong case for joint ownership of CATIA.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The court accepted the principle that allegations in the plaint should be taken as true when challenging jurisdiction at the initial stage (Order VII Rule 10).
    * The court found that the plaint explicitly claimed joint ownership of the software programs by the appellants.
    * The court acknowledged that appellant no. 1 carries on business activities in India through appellant no. 2, giving the Delhi High Court territorial jurisdiction based on Section 62(2) of the Copyright Act.
    * The court recognized that the copyright certificate is only prima facie evidence and does not preclude the appellants from asserting joint ownership.
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The court interpreted Section 62(2) of the Copyright Act to allow suits to be instituted at the location where the plaintiff voluntarily resides or carries on business, even if the principal office is outside India.
    * The court recognized that a company can operate through a subsidiary without compromising its separate legal identity.
    * The court clarified that the certificate of copyright registration is only prima facie evidence and does not definitively resolve the issue of ownership.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The court applied the principle of accepting the plaint's allegations as true at the initial stage of jurisdiction challenge.
    * The court applied Section 62(2) of the Copyright Act to conclude that the Delhi High Court had jurisdiction because appellant no. 1 operates in India through its subsidiary, appellant no. 2.
    * The court declined to consider the respondents' written statement at this stage as it involved contentious issues not suitable for an Order VII Rule 10 application.

## 6. Judgment

* **Final Decision:** The appeal was allowed, and the impugned order (dismissing the suit for lack of jurisdiction) was set aside.
* **Relief Granted:** The case was allowed to proceed in the Delhi High Court.
* **Orders:** All pending applications were also disposed of.

## 7. Implications

* **Impact on Law:** This judgment reinforces the principle that allegations in the plaint are taken as true when challenging jurisdiction at the initial stage. It clarifies that a company can operate through a subsidiary without compromising its separate legal entity for purposes of territorial jurisdiction in copyright cases.
* **Future Relevance:** This case sets a precedent for future cases involving multinational companies and subsidiaries seeking to assert copyright ownership in India. It emphasizes the importance of carefully drafted plaints and the need to consider the specific circumstances of each case.
* **Broader Context:** The case highlights the complexities of territorial jurisdiction in transnational intellectual property disputes. It underscores the need for courts to carefully examine the specific facts of each case to ensure that justice is served.
