This caused significant financial losses for the appellant.

## 4. Arguments Presented

**Appellant’s Argument:**

* The judgment of the Ghent Commercial Court was passed on merits as the court examined documents, considered arguments, and found the appellant's claim to be justified and adequately proven, despite the respondent's non-appearance.
* The appellant is entitled to a decree in India based on the foreign judgment, as it meets the requirements of Section 13 of the CPC.
* If the court finds the foreign judgment not conclusive, the appellant is still entitled to a trial on merits, as the plaint also relies on the original cause of action. 
* The appellant presented evidence and arguments supporting their claim before the Ghent Commercial Court, and the respondent failed to contest these effectively. 
* The respondent has not presented any evidence to show that the judgment was not given on merits or that it violates the principles of natural justice.

**Respondent’s Argument:**

* The judgment of the Ghent Commercial Court was not given on merits, as it was based solely on the respondent's failure to enter an appearance, without examining the merits of the appellant's claim or evidence.
* The appellant's suit is based solely on the foreign judgment and does not seek an independent decree, making it not maintainable.
* The judgment of the Ghent Commercial Court violates the principles of natural justice by failing to provide reasons for the decision.
* The respondent's failure to appear in the Ghent Commercial Court should not be considered a default, as they were unable to defend themselves due to their agent's negligence.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

**Key Findings:**

* The Ghent Commercial Court considered documents, arguments, and the appellant's claim before finding it justified and adequately proven. 
* The court emphasized that the judgment was not based solely on the respondent's non-appearance but was given after examining the material on record and finding the appellant's claim to be justified.
* The respondent failed to provide any concrete evidence to rebut the appellant's claims or to demonstrate that the Ghent Commercial Court's judgment was not given on merits. 
* The court found the respondent's argument that their agent's negligence prevented them from defending themselves insufficient to prove that the judgment was not on merits or violated natural justice. 
* The court also found that the respondent's interpretation of the appellant's authorization being solely for execution of the decree to be insufficient, as it encompasses actions necessary for the execution, which includes instituting a suit for a decree in India.

**Interpretation of Law:**

* The court interpreted Section 13 of the CPC to emphasize that a foreign judgment is conclusive if it meets certain conditions, and the burden of proving that it falls under the exceptions is on the party challenging its validity.
* The court interpreted "judgment on merits" to mean a judgment based on the substance of the case and not solely on procedural defaults.
* The court acknowledged that even an ex-parte decree can be considered on merits if the court assesses evidence and weighs the plaintiff's case.

**Application of Law:**

* The court applied the principles of Section 13 of the CPC and the precedents cited by both parties to determine whether the judgment of the Ghent Commercial Court was conclusive.
* The court found that the respondent failed to meet the burden of proof to show that the Ghent Commercial Court's judgment was not on merits.
* The court applied the doctrine of natural justice in the context of the respondent's argument about their inability to defend themselves due to their agent's negligence and concluded that the respondent failed to prove that the judgment violated natural justice principles.
