* **Legal Doctrines:**
    * **Liberality in Amendment:** The court should generally be liberal in allowing amendments to pleadings unless it would cause irreversible injustice to the opposing party.
    * **Subserving Justice:** The primary objective of amendments is to promote justice and prevent unnecessary litigation.
    * **Time Barred Amendments:** While courts generally disallow amendments introducing time-barred claims, it's not an absolute bar. The discretion rests with the court to allow such amendments in the interest of justice.
    * **Commencement of Trial:** The timing of amendment applications is crucial, as they are generally prohibited after the trial begins. However, the Court defines "commencement of trial" based on specific actions, such as fixing dates for evidence recording.
    * **Material Alteration:** Amendments that introduce entirely new causes of action or materially alter the original suit's basis are usually disallowed.

## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Plaintiff’s Argument:**
    * The Plaintiff sought to amend the memo of parties to correct the name of RPP's proprietor, as they were initially unaware of the actual proprietor, Amit Bansal.
    * The amendment did not alter the cause of action, which remained the recovery of dues from RPP.
    * The amendment was necessary to ensure proper representation of the defendant firm and prevent any procedural delays. 
* **Defendant’s Argument:**
    * The amendment was filed after the trial had commenced, making it inadmissible under the proviso to Order VI Rule 17 of the CPC.
    * The amendment materially altered the cause of action as it introduced a new defendant (Amit Bansal) against whom the original suit did not have a cause of action.
    * The amendment introduced a time-barred claim against Amit Bansal.
    * The suit was defective in its title, as it didn't mention the proprietor's name in the body of the plaint.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The Court found that the Plaintiff's intention was to correct an error in the memo of parties, not to introduce a new cause of action.
    * The amendment did not materially alter the cause of action, as the suit remained against RPP. 
    * The amendment was not barred by limitation, as it did not introduce a new cause of action. 
    * The Court considered the precedents cited by the Defendant but found that they were distinguishable from the present case.
    * The trial had not commenced in the context of the proviso to Order VI Rule 17, as the date for recording evidence had not been fixed.
* **Interpretation of Law:** 
    * The Court emphasized the liberal approach towards amendments under Order VI Rule 17 and the importance of ensuring justice and preventing unnecessary litigation.
    * The Court clarified that the commencement of trial for the purpose of Order VI Rule 17 is determined by specific actions like fixing a date for evidence recording, not merely by framing issues. 
    * The Court emphasized the concept of "cause of action" and how it relates to the underlying factual basis of the suit, not just the named parties.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The Court applied the principles of liberality towards amendments, considering that the amendment did not introduce a new cause of action or prejudice the Defendant.
    * The Court applied the principle of subserving justice, finding that allowing the amendment would prevent unnecessary delays and lead to a more efficient resolution of the dispute.

## 6. Judgment

* **Final Decision:**  The petition filed by Amit Bansal was dismissed with costs. 
* **Relief Granted:** The Court upheld the impugned order of the Commercial Court, allowing the Plaintiff to amend the memo of parties.
* **Orders:** The Defendant was ordered to pay ₹ 50,000/- in costs to the Delhi High Court Legal Services Committee. 

## 7. Implications

* **Impact on Law:** The judgment reinforces the liberal approach taken towards amendments of pleadings, especially in cases where the amendment aims to correct a procedural error and does not introduce a new cause of action or prejudice the opposing party.
* **Future Relevance:**  The case provides a useful precedent for determining when amendments can be allowed even after the framing of issues, but before evidence recording commences. It also clarifies the application of the "cause of action" principle in the context of amendments to pleadings.
* **Broader Context:**  The case underscores the importance of ensuring that parties have the opportunity to correct procedural errors in their pleadings, while simultaneously promoting the efficient administration of justice.
