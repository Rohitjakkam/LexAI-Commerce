## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Plaintiff’s Argument (M/s Obulapuram Mining Company Pvt. Ltd.):**
    * The Commercial Courts Act, 2015, conferred exclusive jurisdiction on the Commercial Court, Vijayawada, to handle commercial disputes exceeding a specified value.
    * The execution of the arbitration award fell under the purview of the Commercial Court Act, 2015, due to the award's value.
    * The Family Court-cum-7th Additional District Judge, Anantapuramu, lacked inherent jurisdiction to entertain the execution petition after the establishment of the Commercial Court.
    *  The plaintiff relied on case law to argue that the Commercial Court was the only competent body to execute the decree.
    * The plaintiff contended that the failure of the respondent to raise an objection to the lack of jurisdiction did not legitimize the Family Court's authority.

* **Defendant’s Argument (R.K. Mining Private Limited):**
    * The Commercial Courts Act, 2015, does not specifically deal with the execution of decrees, and Order 21 of the CPC remains the governing law for execution proceedings.
    * The Commercial Court's jurisdiction is limited to hearing and disposing of commercial disputes, not executing decrees.
    * The respondent relied on case law from Kerala and Chhattisgarh High Courts, which held that the Commercial Courts Act does not confer execution powers.
    * The respondent argued that the plaintiff had adequate remedies under the CPC to challenge the jurisdiction of the Family Court but chose to file a CRP. 

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The court acknowledged the opposing views held by various High Courts regarding the execution powers of the Commercial Courts. 
    * The court emphasized the need for a purposive interpretation of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, to achieve its objectives of quick and efficient disposal of commercial disputes. 
    * The court analyzed Section 15 of the Act and concluded that the word "application" encompasses execution petitions.
    * The court examined Section 36 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, and the amendments made to it, highlighting the clarity provided on executing awards in civil courts.
    * The court emphasized the importance of having a single forum for both dispute resolution and execution to ensure the effectiveness of the Commercial Court system.
    * The court highlighted the inconsistency of the Commercial Court having jurisdiction to decide disputes but lacking the power to execute the decrees.

* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The court interpreted Section 15 of the Act to include "execution applications" within the meaning of "applications".
    * The court interpreted Section 16 of the Act as a clear indication of the legislature's intent to streamline the trial and disposal of commercial disputes within the Commercial Courts.
    * The court interpreted the deliberate omission of Order 21 of the CPC in the Act as a conscious decision to focus on streamlining the trial process within the Commercial Courts.
    * The court interpreted the silence of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, regarding other provisions of the CPC as not intended to render the Commercial Courts ineffective.
    * The court interpreted the dismissal of the SLP filed against the judgment in the OCI Corporation case as support for the conclusion that the Commercial Court has jurisdiction over execution proceedings.

* **Application of Law:**
    * The court applied the doctrine of harmonious construction and purposive interpretation to analyze the relevant legal provisions.
    * The court applied the principle of inherent lack of jurisdiction to hold that the Family Court, Anantapuramu, was a coram non-judice after the establishment of the Commercial Court, Vijayawada.
    * The court applied the judgment in the Jaycee Housing Private limited case to support the view that the Commercial Court should have jurisdiction over both dispute resolution and execution.
    * The court applied the principle of judicial restraint by acknowledging the judgment in the Dhulabhai case but distinguishing it based on the statutory embargo imposed by the Commercial Courts Act, 2015.

## 6. Judgment

* **Relief Granted:** The court declared that all orders passed by the Family Court-cum-7th Additional District Judge, Anantapuramu, after 16.05.2019, were non-est in the eye of law due to the lack of jurisdiction.
* **Orders:**
    * The execution petition, E.P.No.13 of 2016, was transferred to the Commercial Court, Vijayawada, which had jurisdiction over the Anantapuramu District.
