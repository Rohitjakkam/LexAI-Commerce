## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Appellant's Argument:**
    * The impugned order passed by the arbitrator is an interlocutory order falling under Section 37(2)(b) of the Act and therefore, an appeal against it is maintainable before the Gujarat High Court. 
    * Section 84 of the Multi State Cooperative Societies Act, 2002 governs the arbitration proceedings, and the order passed by the arbitrator appointed under the Act can be challenged under the provisions of the Arbitration Act.
* **Respondent's Argument:**
    * The appeal under Section 37 of the Act is not maintainable before the Gujarat High Court as the High Court does not possess original jurisdiction in arbitration matters. 
    * The "Court" under Section 2(1)(e) of the Act refers to the principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction in a district, which is the Court of District Judge. 
    * The appellant should have filed the appeal before the Court of District Judge instead of the Gujarat High Court.

## 5. Courtâ€™s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The Gujarat High Court does not have original jurisdiction in arbitration matters, except for international commercial arbitration.
    * The term "Court" under Section 2(1)(e) of the Act refers to the principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction in a district, which is the Court of District Judge. 
    * The Commercial Courts Act does not override the provisions of the Arbitration Act, and the jurisdiction of Commercial Courts is limited to specific cases. 
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The court interprets Section 2(1)(e) of the Act and clarifies that the term "Court" refers to the principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction in a district, which is the Court of District Judge, not the High Court. 
* **Application of Law:**
    * The court applies the interpretation of the Act to the facts of the case and concludes that the appeal is not maintainable before the Gujarat High Court.

## 6. Judgment

* **Final Decision:** The first appeal is dismissed as not maintainable before the Gujarat High Court.
* **Relief Granted:** No relief is granted as the appeal is dismissed.

## 7. Implications

* **Future Relevance:** The judgment serves as a precedent for future cases involving the maintainability of appeals under Section 37 of the Act. It clarifies the jurisdictional limits of the High Court and the Court of District Judge in arbitration matters.
* **Broader Context:** The judgment underscores the importance of understanding the jurisdictional framework for appeals under the Arbitration Act. 

## 8. Summary Points
