## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Plaintiff’s Argument:**
    * The plaintiffs argued that the suit was originally filed in the Delhi High Court, and they had the right to choose the forum. 
    * They argued that the change in pecuniary jurisdiction shouldn't force them to file the case in the subordinate court.
    * They asserted that the Delhi High Court could still deal with the amendment application even after the transfer order by the Chief Justice.
    * They relied on the Supreme Court judgments in Lakha Ram Sharma and Mount Mary Enterprises to support their claim.
    * They argued that transferring the case to the subordinate court for a mere valuation amendment would cause undue delay and inconvenience, defeating the purpose of the Commercial Courts Act.
* **Defendant’s Argument:**
    * The defendants argued that the Delhi High Court had become functus officio (meaning it no longer had jurisdiction) to deal with the amendment application since the suit was transferred to the subordinate court.
    * They cited several Delhi High Court judgments to support their contention.
    * They argued that the amendment application should be dealt with by the subordinate court to which the case was transferred.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**

    * The court considered the precedents cited by both parties and attempted to reconcile conflicting positions.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The court applied the principles of jurisdiction, inherent jurisdiction, and amendment of pleadings to the specific facts of the case.
    * The court found that the amendment sought by the plaintiffs was merely a formal amendment for valuation purposes and would not prejudice the defendants.
    * The court considered the potential delays and inconvenience that would arise from transferring the case for such a minor amendment.
