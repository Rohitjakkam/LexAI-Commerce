## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Plaintiff’s Argument:**
    *  A large number of IPR matters valued below Rs. 3 lakhs are pending before the District Judges (non-Commercial) and these should be allowed to continue there.
    * Reliance on the definition of 'specified value' in Section 2(c)(xvii) of the CCA, arguing that suits valued below Rs. 3 lakhs are not within the purview of Commercial Courts.
    * Cited various case precedents supporting their argument.
    * Stated they would have no objection to the matter being heard by the Commercial Court.
* **Defendant’s Argument:**
    *  All IPR cases, irrespective of value, should be adjudicated by Commercial Courts.
    * The intent of the CCA is to ensure speedy resolution of commercial disputes.
    * The "specified value" of a suit cannot be ignored and should be considered along with the subject matter of the dispute.
    * The plaintiff's right to choose the forum is not unfettered and should not allow them to avoid the provisions of the CCA.
    * Argued for a more stringent valuation process for IP cases, considering the market value of intangible rights.
    * Cited several case precedents supporting their argument.
    * Argued for the importance of harmoniously interpreting the provisions of the CCA and IPR statutes.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The Court acknowledged that all IPR cases are "commercial disputes" within the definition of the CCA.
    * The Court clarified that the "specified value" of Rs. 3 lakhs, as defined in the CCA, is not a mere procedural matter, but a substantive element that determines the applicability of the Act's provisions.
    * The Court recognized the potential for undervaluation of IP suits to avoid the CCA's rigorous procedures.
    * The Court observed that while the Plaintiff has the right to value their suit, this right is not absolute and cannot be exercised to the detriment of the CCA's objectives.
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The Court interpreted the CCA, specifically the definition of "specified value," to indicate that the "specified value" threshold is crucial for applying the Act's provisions.
    * The Court analyzed the intention behind the 2018 Amendment to the CCA, which lowered the "specified value" from Rs. 1 crore to Rs. 3 lakhs, and concluded that the purpose was to extend the benefits of the CCA to a wider range of commercial disputes.
    * The Court reconciled the provisions of the CCA with those of the IPR statutes, emphasizing the need for a harmonized interpretation.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The Court recognized that while the plaintiff has the right to determine the value of their suit, this right cannot be used to arbitrarily undervalue IP cases to avoid the CCA's provisions.
    * The Court reasoned that the "specified value" should be determined not solely on the basis of the relief sought, but also by considering the market value of the intangible right involved in the IP dispute.
    * The Court emphasized that the objective of the CCA is to ensure speedy resolution of commercial disputes and that allowing undervaluation would undermine this objective.

## 6. Judgment

* **Final Decision:**
    * The Court ruled in favor of the Defendant, holding that the Commercial Courts, specifically the District Judges designated as Commercial Courts, have jurisdiction over all IPR cases in Delhi, irrespective of their value.
* **Relief Granted:**
    * The Court directed that all pending IPR suits before the District Judges (non-Commercial) in Delhi should be transferred to the District Judges (Commercial).
* **Orders:**
    * The Court ordered that all IPR cases in Delhi, even those valued below Rs. 3 lakhs, should be initially filed before the District Judges (Commercial).
    * The Court instructed that the District Judges (Commercial) should examine the "specified value" of such cases to determine whether the valuation is arbitrary or unreasonable.
    * The Court directed that if the valuation is found to be arbitrary, the District Judges (Commercial) should direct the Plaintiff to amend their plaint and pay the requisite court fee.
    * The Court directed that even IPR cases valued below Rs. 3 lakhs, which are ultimately adjudicated as non-commercial suits, should continue to be listed before the District Judges (Commercial).
