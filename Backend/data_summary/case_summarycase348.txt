**2. Background and Context**

* **Brief Overview:**  Venkatesh Vincom Private Limited (Appellant) filed a suit against M/S. Spice of Joy (Respondent) to recover a loan amount of Rs. 97,65,333/- along with interest.

The Appellant claimed the Respondent defaulted on repayment, and they filed the suit before the Commercial Court at Alipore.
* **Key Issues:** The key legal question was whether the dispute between the parties qualified as a "commercial dispute" under Section 2(1)(c)(i) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015. If not, the Commercial Court lacked jurisdiction to hear the case.

**3. Legal Principles Involved**

* **Relevant Statutes and Provisions:**
    * **Commercial Courts Act, 2015:** Section 2(1)(c)(i) defining "Commercial dispute" as a dispute arising out of ordinary transactions of merchants, bankers, financiers, and traders relating to mercantile documents.
    * **Code of Civil Procedure (CPC):** Order 7 Rule 11 read with Section 151 for rejection of the plaint. 
    * **Indian Partnership Act, 1932:**  Sections 18, 19, and 22 regarding the liability of partners and the firm for acts done by a partner.

    * **Jurisdiction:** The court examined the jurisdiction of the Commercial Court based on the nature of the dispute.

**4. Arguments Presented**

* **Appellant’s Argument:** 
    * The loan agreement between the Appellant (non-banking financial company) and the Respondent (business establishment) constituted an "ordinary transaction of a financier" as per Section 2(1)(c)(i) of the Commercial Courts Act.
    * The receipts, acknowledgement, and bank statements were considered "mercantile documents" and the dispute involved their enforcement and interpretation.
    * The Commercial Court erred in returning the plaint, lacking reasoning and proper consideration of the arguments.
* **Respondent’s Argument:**
    * The loan was extended to an individual partner, not the business establishment, and thus didn't fall under "ordinary transactions" of a financier as defined in the Act.
    * The loan was a "friendly loan" and not a commercial transaction based on a "mercantile document" as required by the Act. 
    * The appellant had not adhered to the Reserve Bank of India's fair practices code for non-banking financial companies.
    * The Commercial Court correctly returned the plaint, as the dispute didn't satisfy the conditions of a commercial dispute and could clog the system.

    * The loan, though provided to one partner, was utilized by the firm and the firm had paid interest, making it a transaction with the firm.
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The court emphasized the broad interpretation of "mercantile document" within the Act, considering any document used for recording transactions as eligible.
    * It referred to the definition of "commercial paper" from Black's Law Dictionary and Stroud's Judicial Dictionary to further clarify the meaning of "mercantile" and "commercial action."
