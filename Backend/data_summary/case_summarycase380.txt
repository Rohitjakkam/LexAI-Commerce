##  Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited vs. Rajinder Singh Joon & Ors.

**1. Case Title**

* **Case Name:** Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited vs. Rajinder Singh Joon & Ors.
* **Court:** Delhi High Court
* **Date of Judgment:** 10th April 2024
* **Citation:**  RFA(COMM) 14/2024 & RFA(COMM) 15/2024

**2. Background and Context**

* **Brief Overview:** The dispute arose from a lease agreement between Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) and the respondents, the owners of a plot in New Delhi. The lease agreement, executed in 2003, had a 20-year term and included a renewal clause. Upon the lease's expiry in 2022, the respondents refused to renew, leading BPCL to file a counterclaim seeking specific performance of the renewal clause. 
* **Key Issues:**
    * Whether the renewal clause in the lease agreement automatically renewed the lease for another 20 years.
    * Whether the respondents were bound to renew the lease despite the absence of mutual agreement on the renewal period.
    * Whether a court could grant specific performance of the renewal clause in a determinable contract.

    * **Specific Performance:** The court examined the conditions for granting specific performance of a contract. 

**4. Arguments Presented**

* **Appellant's (BPCL) Argument:**
    * The renewal clause in the lease agreement was clear and unambiguous, automatically renewing the lease for another 20 years upon the lessee (BPCL) giving notice.
    * The parties' intention to renew the lease for another 20 years was evident from the post-litigation settlement that led to the lease agreement.
    * The renewal of a separate Dispensing Pump and Selling License (DPSL) Agreement between the parties for a period after the lease expiry demonstrated their shared intention to renew the lease.
    * The appellant had invoked the renewal clause by sending notice to the respondents during the lease period. 
* **Respondent's Argument:** 
    * The renewal clause stipulated a period of "NIL years," indicating that the parties intended to negotiate the renewal period.
    * The appellant's letter seeking renewal acknowledged that renewal required mutual agreement.
    * The respondents denied receiving the appellant's alleged notices to renew.
    *  A determinable contract, like the lease agreement, could not be specifically enforced under Section 14(1)(c) of the Specific Relief Act.

**5. Courtâ€™s Analysis and Reasoning**

* **Key Findings:**
    * The renewal clause contained a blank for the renewal period, indicating the intention to negotiate the duration of renewal.
    * The appellant's own letter seeking renewal acknowledged the need for mutually agreed terms.
    * The appellant failed to provide evidence of serving the alleged notices to renew.
    * The separate DPSL agreement did not provide a conclusive indication of the parties' intention to renew the lease.
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The court interpreted the renewal clause based on its plain text, finding that it did not automatically renew the lease for another 20 years.
    * The court applied the principle that a contract should be interpreted based on the expressed intent of the parties.
    * The court relied on the principle that oral evidence cannot be admitted to contradict or vary the terms of a written contract.
    * The court applied the provisions of Section 14(1)(c) of the Specific Relief Act, holding that specific performance of a determinable contract could not be granted.
* **Application of Law:** 
    * The court applied the above legal principles to the facts of the case, finding that the appellant had failed to establish a right to automatic renewal or to enforce specific performance of the renewal clause. 

**6. Judgment**

* **Final Decision:** The Delhi High Court dismissed both appeals filed by BPCL.
* **Relief Granted:** The court upheld the judgment of the Commercial Court, granting possession of the property to the respondents and dismissing the appellant's counterclaim for specific performance. 
* **Orders:** The court ordered BPCL to vacate the property and pay costs to the respondents.

**7. Implications**

* **Impact on Law:** The judgment clarifies that a renewal clause containing a blank for the renewal period does not automatically renew the contract for the same term. It reinforces the principle that specific performance is not available for determinable contracts.
* **Future Relevance:** The case provides guidance on interpreting renewal clauses and the limitations of specific performance for such clauses. 
* **Broader Context:** The judgment emphasizes the importance of clearly defining the terms of contracts, especially for renewal provisions, and the need for mutual agreement for valid renewal.

**8. Summary Points**

* The renewal clause in the lease agreement did not automatically renew the lease for another 20 years.
*  The renewal required mutual agreement on the period of renewal.
* Specific performance of a determinable contract, such as the lease agreement, is not available under the law.
