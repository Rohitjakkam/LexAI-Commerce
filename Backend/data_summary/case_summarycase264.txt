    * The defendant's actions were causing irreparable harm to the plaintiff's business and reputation.
* **Defendant’s Argument:**
    * The defendant had been operating since 2020 and was not directly competing with the plaintiff's specific product line of mattresses and pillows.
    * The defendant's use of "Sunday Design" was distinct enough to avoid confusion with the plaintiff's trademark.

* **Application of Law:** The court found that the commercial court had failed to apply the law correctly by granting ex parte injunction without properly considering the defendant's arguments and the relevant precedents cited.

## 6. Judgment
