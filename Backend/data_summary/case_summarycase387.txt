## 1. Case Title

* **Case Name:** M/S. Mytrah Energy India Private Limited vs. M/S. Siemens Gamesa Renewable Power Private Limited
* **Court:** Telangana High Court
* **Date of Judgment:** 21st April 2023
* **Citation:** COMCA Nos.6 & 7 of 2023

## 2. Background and Context

* **Brief Overview:** This case involved a dispute between M/S. Mytrah Energy (India) Private Limited (hereinafter referred to as "Mytrah") and M/S. Siemens Gamesa Renewable Power Private Limited (hereinafter referred to as "Siemens").  The dispute arose from a Multi Annual Agreement (MAA) signed in 2011 for the purchase and supply of Wind Turbine Generators (WTGs).  Siemens was obligated to offtake a minimum volume of WTGs each year, while Mytrah was required to make substantial investments to fulfill its supply obligations.  Siemens allegedly defaulted on its commitment to purchase the agreed-upon volume of WTGs, leading Mytrah to claim liquidated damages.

## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Mytrah’s Argument (Appellant/Respondent):**
    * The Commercial Court erred in granting reliefs under Section 9 after the arbitral award was passed but before its enforcement under Section 36.
    * The Commercial Court lacked jurisdiction to grant certain specific reliefs, including the return of bank guarantees, which were not directly sought in the petition.
    * The Commercial Court's orders were in excess of the reliefs prayed for and suffered from jurisdictional error.
* **Siemens’ Argument (Respondent/Petitioner):**
    * The scope of Section 9 applications is broad and coexists with the execution proceedings under Section 36.
    * The decree holder (Mytrah) is entitled to seek interlocutory relief under Section 9 to protect their interests and prevent the respondent (Siemens) from frustrating the enforcement of the arbitral award.
    * The Commercial Court correctly granted limited reliefs to Mytrah to ensure the preservation of assets and to safeguard the interest of the decree holder.
    * The return of bank guarantees was necessary to prevent further hardship to Mytrah due to the non-closure of the bank guarantee accounts.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning
