## 1. Case Title

* **Case Name:** M/S. M.G. Mohanty And Another vs State Of Odisha And Others
* **Court:** Orissa High Court
* **Date of Judgment:** 8th April 2022
* **Citation:**  Not provided in the text.

## 2. Background and Context

**Brief Overview:**
This case involves five writ petitions challenging a notification issued by the State of Odisha establishing Commercial Courts under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 (CC Act). The petitioners, various businesses and individuals engaged in arbitration proceedings, argue that the notification, by conferring jurisdiction on Senior Civil Judges (Commercial Courts), violates the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (A&C Act) which requires such matters to be heard by the Principal Civil Court (District & Sessions Judge). 

**Key Issues:**
1. Whether jurisdiction under Sections 9, 14, 34, etc., of the A&C Act can be conferred on a judicial officer subordinate to the rank of a District Judge (i.e., Principal Civil Judge).
2. Whether the State Government's power under the CC Act overrides the provisions of the A&C Act, particularly Section 42.

**Precedents Cited:**

* **Kandla Export Corporation v. OCI Corporation (2018) 14 SCC 715:** The Supreme Court held that the A&C Act is a special statute and prevails over the CC Act, which is a general statute.
* **Fuerst Day Lawson Ltd v. Jindal Exports Ltd. (2011) 8 SCC 333:** This case is cited in Kandla Export Corporation to support the characterization of the CC Act as a general statute. 
* **Innoventive Industries Ltd. v. ICICI Bank and others (2018) 1 SCC 407:** The Court emphasizes the need for clear and irreconcilable inconsistency between statutes before holding them to be in direct collision.
* **New India Assurance Company Limited v. Shanti Misra (1975) 2 SCC 840:**  This case holds that a change in law concerning procedural matters operates retrospectively, requiring parties to proceed in the new forum even if their cause of action arose prior to the change.
* **State of Maharashtra, through Executive Engineer v. Atlanta Limited (2014) 11 SCC 619:**  This case is relied upon by the Madhya Pradesh High Court in Yashwardhan Raghuwanshi to emphasize the Court of the District Judge as the superior most jurisdiction in a district.
* **Yashwardhan Raghuwanshi v. District & Sessions Judge 2021 SCC OnLine MP 457:** The Madhya Pradesh High Court held that only a Court of the status of District Judge or Additional District Judge can handle arbitration matters under the A&C Act, rejecting the assignment of such matters to Civil Judge Class-I.
* **Apollo Real Estate LLP v. Dr. Arun Waghmare 2019 SCC OnLine MP 2570:**  This case, not referenced in Yashwardhan Raghuwanshi, comes to a different conclusion, favoring the applicability of Section 10(2) and 15(2) of the CC Act over the A&C Act.
* **Gaurang Mangesh Suctancar v. Sonia Gaurang Suctancar:**  The Bombay High Court, in this case, concludes that the provisions of the CC Act prevail over the A&C Act. 

**Legal Doctrines:**

* **Generalia Specialibus Non-Derogant:** This maxim suggests that general law should not override special law. However, the Court rejects the applicability of this maxim in this case, arguing that both the A&C Act and the CC Act are special statutes, and the later enacted CC Act should prevail.
* **Harmonious Construction:**  The Court emphasizes the need to interpret the provisions of the two statutes in a way that ensures they co-exist harmoniously.
* **Purposive Construction:** The Court considers the objectives and purposes of both the CC Act and the A&C Act, focusing on their shared goal of providing for speedy resolution of disputes.

## 4. Arguments Presented

**Plaintiff’s Argument (Petitioners):**

* The A&C Act is a special statute, and its provisions regarding the definition of "Court" and the exclusive jurisdiction of the Principal Civil Court prevail over the general provisions of the CC Act.
* The maxim "generalia specialibus non-derogant" applies, meaning that the general law of the CC Act should yield to the special law of the A&C Act.
* Section 21 of the CC Act, which provides for overriding effect, does not override the provisions of the A&C Act.
* Reliance on the decision in Kandla Export Corporation v. OCI Corporation to support the argument that the A&C Act prevails.
* Reliance on the Madhya Pradesh High Court judgment in Yashwardhan Raghuwanshi to support the argument that arbitration matters should be heard only by Courts of the status of District Judge or Additional District Judge.

**Defendant’s Argument (Opposite Parties):**

* There is no apparent conflict between the A&C Act and the CC Act; both are special statutes, and the later enacted CC Act prevails.
* The inconsistency between the two Acts must be clear, direct, and irreconcilable (based on Innoventive Industries).
* A purposive and harmonious construction should be applied, and the legislature intended to provide a specific forum (Commercial Courts) for resolving arbitration disputes under the CC Act.
* The CC Act aims at speedy adjudication of commercial disputes, including arbitration matters, and its procedural provisions can co-exist harmoniously with the substantive provisions of the A&C Act.
* Reliance on the decision in New India Assurance Company Limited v. Shanti Misra to argue that the change in forum (from Principal Civil Court to Commercial Court) operates retrospectively.
* Reliance on the Bombay High Court judgment in Gaurang Mangesh Suctancar to argue that the CC Act prevails over the A&C Act.
* The CC Act provides for a two-tier system of Commercial Courts, with original jurisdiction at a lower level and appellate jurisdiction at the District Judge level, which ensures proper adjudication of commercial disputes.

**Key Findings:**
