* **Court:** Allahabad High Court, Lucknow Bench
* **Date of Judgment:** 1st September 2022
* **Citation:** Not provided in the text. 

## 2. Background and Context

**Brief Overview:** This case involves a dispute between M/S Zapdor-Ubc-Abnjv Delhi (Petitioner), a joint venture company, and the Union of India through the General Manager of Northern Railway (Respondent).  The dispute arises from a contract awarded to the Petitioner for electrification work on a railway section in Lucknow. The Respondent terminated the contract citing slow progress, and the Petitioner invoked the arbitration clause in the contract. The Arbitral Tribunal awarded over three crores to the Petitioner, which the Respondent challenged before the Commercial Court in Lucknow. The Petitioner then filed a petition in the Allahabad High Court, arguing that the Commercial Court lacked territorial jurisdiction to hear the case.

**Key Issues:**

* Whether the petition filed in the High Court is maintainable.
* Whether the Commercial Court in Lucknow had jurisdiction to entertain the Respondent's Section 34 application to challenge the Arbitral Award.
* Whether the "seat" of arbitration, as determined by the parties' conduct, should override the potential jurisdictional claim based on the "cause of action" arising in Lucknow.

## 4. Arguments Presented

**Plaintiff’s Argument (Petitioner):**

* **Jurisdiction:** The Petitioner argued that the Commercial Court in Lucknow lacked jurisdiction to hear the Respondent's challenge to the Arbitral Award. They claimed that the "seat" of arbitration, as determined by the conduct of the parties, was New Delhi, where the arbitral proceedings were held and the Award was delivered.  
* **Cause of Action:** They asserted that the cause of action for the Respondent's Section 34 application did not arise in Lucknow. The contract was terminated and the arbitration proceedings conducted in New Delhi.
* **Interpretation of BALCO:** The Petitioner argued that the Commercial Court misconstrued the Supreme Court's decision in BALCO, incorrectly holding that the court where the cause of action arises has concurrent jurisdiction with the court at the seat of arbitration. They cited subsequent Supreme Court judgments in Soma JV and others to support their interpretation of BALCO.
* **Contractual Clauses:** The Petitioner highlighted the contractual clauses concerning the venue of arbitration, arguing that these clauses, combined with the parties' conduct, clearly established New Delhi as the seat of arbitration.
* **Condonation of Delay:** The Petitioner criticized the Commercial Court's decision to condone the Respondent's delay in filing the Section 34 application, arguing that the Respondent's explanation of bureaucratic delay was insufficient. 
* **Maintainability of the Petition:** The Petitioner argued that the petition was maintainable, despite being filed by one director of the joint venture company, as he had been authorized by all parties to represent the joint venture throughout the arbitration process.

**Defendant’s Argument (Respondent):**

* **Maintainability of the Petition:**  The Respondent raised a preliminary objection regarding the maintainability of the petition, arguing that only one director of the joint venture company had filed the petition, without proper authorization from the other partners.
* **Maintainability under Article 227:**  They argued that the petition was not maintainable under Article 227 of the Constitution, as a remedy of appeal under Section 37 of the 1996 Act was available for an interlocutory order like the one challenged.
* **Jurisdiction:** The Respondent argued that the Commercial Court in Lucknow had jurisdiction to hear the Section 34 application. They cited various contractual clauses, including the "General Conditions of Contract," to demonstrate that the "place of arbitration" was determined to be within the geographical limits of the Railway Division where the work was being executed, which was Lucknow.
* **Cause of Action:** The Respondent argued that a significant part of the cause of action arose in Lucknow, as the project was executed there and the Chief Project Director responsible for the contract was based in Lucknow.
* **Seat of Arbitration:**  They argued that the parties had not expressly agreed on a "seat" of arbitration in New Delhi, and that the arbitral proceedings held there were only for convenience. 
* **Condonation of Delay:** The Respondent argued that the delay in filing the Section 34 application was minor, caused by bureaucratic complexities, and that the Commercial Court was justified in condoning the delay.
* **Enforcement in Delhi High Court:** The Respondent highlighted the Petitioner's actions in seeking enforcement of the arbitral award in the Delhi High Court, which they argued conflicted with their current petition challenging the jurisdiction of the Commercial Court in Lucknow.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

**Key Findings:**

* **Maintainability of the Petition:** The Court found that the petition was maintainable, despite being filed by only one director of the joint venture company, considering the Petitioner's authorization to act on behalf of the joint venture in the arbitration proceedings and the lack of objection by the Respondent regarding representation before the Arbitral Tribunal.
* **Maintainability under Article 227:** The Court, relying on the Supreme Court's decision in Soma JV, concluded that the petition under Article 227 was maintainable as the impugned order rejecting the application for return of the Section 34 application was not an order that could be appealed under Section 37 of the 1996 Act.
* **Seat of Arbitration vs. Venue:** The Court affirmed the distinction between "seat" and "venue" of arbitration as established in BALCO and subsequent cases. It recognized that the "seat" of arbitration is crucial for determining applicable law and supervisory jurisdiction.
* **Determination of Seat:** The Court held that in the absence of an express agreement designating the "seat" of arbitration, the conduct of the parties can be decisive. In this case, the Respondent's participation in the arbitration proceedings at New Delhi, without raising any objections, demonstrated their tacit acceptance of New Delhi as the seat of arbitration, despite the potential for ambiguity in the contractual clauses.
* **Exclusive Jurisdiction:** The Court emphasized that once the "seat" of arbitration is established, the courts situated at that location have exclusive jurisdiction over disputes arising from the arbitration proceedings. This principle applies even if part of the cause of action arises elsewhere.
* **Condonation of Delay:** The Court found that the Commercial Court's decision to condone the Respondent's delay was justified, considering the delay was minor and caused by bureaucratic complexities.
* **Enforcement in Delhi High Court:** The Court acknowledged the Petitioner's efforts to enforce the arbitral award in the Delhi High Court but stated that this action did not preclude them from challenging the jurisdiction of the Commercial Court in Lucknow.

**Interpretation of Law:**

* **Section 20 of the 1996 Act:** The Court interpreted Section 20 of the 1996 Act, recognizing the importance of party autonomy in choosing the place of arbitration. However, it also acknowledged the possibility of determining the "seat" of arbitration based on the parties' conduct when an express agreement is absent.
* **BALCO and Soma JV:** The Court harmonized the Supreme Court's decisions in BALCO and Soma JV, concluding that while the court where the cause of action arises can have jurisdiction, the court at the "seat" of arbitration has exclusive jurisdiction, especially when the parties' conduct unequivocally establishes that "seat."

**Application of Law:**

* The Court applied the legal principles established in BALCO, Soma JV, and other relevant precedents to the facts of the case, considering the contractual clauses, the parties' conduct, and the location of the arbitral proceedings.
* The Court rejected the Respondent's arguments based on the "cause of action" arising in Lucknow, prioritizing the determination of the "seat" of arbitration based on the conduct of the parties.

## 6. Judgment

**Final Decision:**

* The petition filed by M/S Zapdor-Ubc-Abnjv Delhi was allowed.

**Relief Granted:**

* The order of the Commercial Court in Lucknow dated 12.12.2019, rejecting the Petitioner's application for return of the Section 34 application, was set aside. 

**Orders:**

* The proceedings before the Commercial Court in Lucknow were deemed vitiated and liable to be set aside due to the court's lack of jurisdiction.

## 7. Implications

* This judgment reaffirms the crucial distinction between "seat" and "venue" of arbitration in determining jurisdictional claims under the 1996 Act.
* It underscores the importance of the "seat" of arbitration as the determinative factor for exclusive supervisory jurisdiction.
* The judgment emphasizes the weight given to the parties' conduct in establishing the "seat" when an express agreement is lacking. 

**Future Relevance:**

* It demonstrates the potential for the parties' conduct to override seemingly conflicting contractual terms and establish the "seat" of arbitration.
