## 1. Case Title

* **Case Name:** India Power Corporation Limited (IPCL) vs. Jefferies India Private Limited & Anr.
* **Court:** Calcutta High Court (Appellete Side)
* **Date of Judgment:** 24th August 2023
* **Citation:** Not provided in the text.

## 2. Background and Context

* **Brief Overview:**  India Power Corporation Limited (IPCL) filed a money suit against Jefferies India Private Limited, claiming a decree for Rs. 9,01,8,185/- along with interest. The suit initially began in the Civil Judge (Senior Division) 2nd Court, Barasat but was transferred to the Commercial Court at Rajarhat due to a High Court notification establishing the Commercial Court.  The defendant, Jefferies India Private Limited, missed several deadlines to file a written statement, which led to the suit being listed for ex-parte hearing. The defendant subsequently appeared and sought to have the case removed from the ex-parte board, but this request was denied by the Commercial Court. The defendant filed two revisional applications challenging these decisions.
* **Key Issues:**
    * Whether the Commercial Court was obligated to provide notice to the defendant about the transfer of the case.
    * Whether the defendant, after appearing and filing an application under Order VII Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure, should have been allowed to participate in the proceedings.
    * Whether the Commercial Court erred in proceeding with the ex-parte hearing and refusing to allow the defendant to file a written statement.

    * The defendant's actions are intended to obstruct the proceedings and delay the judgment.
