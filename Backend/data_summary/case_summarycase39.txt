* **Legal Doctrines:**
    * Principle of Party Autonomy: The freedom of parties to choose arbitration as a method of dispute resolution and to determine its processes.
    * Court Subsidiarity Model:  A model where the Court's role in granting interim relief is limited, and preference is given to the Arbitral Tribunal.
    * Interpretation of Statutes: The application of established rules and principles to understand the meaning and intent of statutory provisions. 

## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Plaintiff’s Argument (AMNS):**
    * Once the Arbitral Tribunal is constituted, the Court should not entertain Section 9 applications for interim relief.
    *  The word "entertain" in Section 9(3) means to consider and adjudicate upon the application, not simply to admit it.
    * The Court should only entertain Section 9 applications if the remedy under Section 17 is not efficacious.
    * The Commercial Court acted beyond its jurisdiction by not referring the matter to the Arbitral Tribunal and by continuing to hear the Section 9 application.
    * The International practice of "Court Subsidiarity" supports the view that the Court should defer to the Arbitral Tribunal.
* **Defendant’s Argument (EBTL):**
    *  The Commercial Court has jurisdiction to entertain the Section 9 applications, even after the Arbitral Tribunal is constituted.
    *  The petitioner's petition is premature, as the Commercial Court is yet to pronounce its order on the Section 9 applications.
    *  The word "entertain" in Section 9(3) refers to the initial admission and hearing of the application, not its final adjudication.
    *  The urgency of EBTL's need for interim relief outweighs the preference for the Arbitral Tribunal to decide.
    *  The High Court should not interfere with the Commercial Court's proceedings unless exceptional circumstances or bad faith are shown.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The Gujarat High Court acknowledged that the word "entertain" in Section 9(3) can have different interpretations, but emphasized its meaning in the context of the statute and its purpose.
    * The court rejected the petitioner's argument that "entertain" means to adjudicate upon and dispose of the application, holding that it only means to initially consider and hear the application.
    * The court found that while the Commercial Court could not be prevented from passing an order on the Section 9 applications, the petitioner's application seeking to refer the disputes to the Arbitral Tribunal was premature, as the Commercial Court had not yet considered the efficacy of the remedy under Section 17.
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The court interpreted Section 9(3) of the Act to mean that the Court shall not entertain an application under Section 9(1) after the Arbitral Tribunal is constituted, unless it finds that the remedy under Section 17 is not efficacious.
    *  The court highlighted the legislative intent behind the 2015 amendment to Section 9, which aimed to reduce the Court's role in arbitration and promote party autonomy.
    *  The court considered the arguments regarding the interpretation of the word "entertain" and ultimately concluded that it should be understood in the context of the specific statutory provision and its purpose.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The court held that the petitioner's application seeking to refer the disputes to the Arbitral Tribunal was premature because the Commercial Court had not yet considered the efficacy of the remedy under Section 17.
    * The court found that the petitioner's petition was not a suitable case for intervention under Article 227, as the Commercial Court still had jurisdiction to decide the Section 9 application, and the petitioner had an alternate remedy through an appeal under Section 37 of the Act.

## 6. Judgment

* **Final Decision:** The Gujarat High Court dismissed the petition under Article 227 of the Constitution.
* **Relief Granted:** No relief was granted to the petitioner.
* **Orders:** The Court directed the Commercial Court not to pronounce its order on both Section 9 applications until September 3, 2021, allowing the petitioner time to appeal to the Supreme Court.

## 7. Implications

* **Impact on Law:**
    * This judgment provides further clarification on the interpretation of Section 9(3) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.
    * The court's interpretation of the word "entertain" reinforces the principle that the Court should not interfere with the arbitral process unless there are compelling reasons to do so.
    * The judgment emphasizes the significance of the Court's role in assessing the efficacy of the remedy under Section 17 before entertaining Section 9 applications.
* **Future Relevance:**
    * This case is likely to be cited in future cases involving the interpretation of Section 9(3) of the Act, particularly in situations where the Arbitral Tribunal has been constituted.
    * The judgment provides guidance to courts on the appropriate circumstances for intervention under Article 227 in relation to arbitration proceedings.
* **Broader Context:**
    * This case reflects a continuing trend in Indian law to prioritize party autonomy and reduce judicial intervention in arbitration.
    * The judgment reinforces the importance of ensuring that arbitration proceedings are conducted efficiently and effectively.

## 8. Summary Points
