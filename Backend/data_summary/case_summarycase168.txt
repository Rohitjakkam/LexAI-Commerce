## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Appellants' (SPDC & SoS) Argument:** 
    * The Sole Arbitrator awarded reliefs not sought by ATPL.
    * The award was against public policy, as it contradicted fundamental principles of Indian law and basic notions of justice.
    * The award was vitiated by patent illegality, as the Arbitrator made decisions beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration and misconstrued the Second Agreement. 
    * The award was based on non-application of mind and disregarded vital evidence.
    * ATPL had not laid any groundwork for the HEPs and yet received a substantial award.

* **Respondent's (ATPL) Argument:**
    * SPDC & SoS admitted certain facts in their reply to the claim petition, which led to the Sole Arbitrator not framing specific issues. 
    * There is no statutory provision to support the argument that SPDC & SoS's obligations did not commence until ATPL submitted the DPRs.
    * The failure to lay any groundwork for the HEPs was attributable to SPDC & SoS's delays and not ATPL's.
    * The minutes of the meetings between the parties modified the terms of the Second Agreement.
    * The Sole Arbitrator had examined each issue and rendered findings, most of which remained unassailed.
    * The appeal filed by SPDC & SoS was an assortment of contradictory pleas.
    * The Sole Arbitrator had considered cost escalation based on reasonable calculations and norms.

## 5. Court's Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The minutes of the meetings between the parties did not amount to a valid modification of the Second Agreement.
    * ATPL failed to take over the responsibility of the bond amount, interest thereon, and provide bank guarantee as per clause 2 of the Second Agreement.
    * ATPL failed to submit DPRs for Chakungchu and Ralong HEPs and a revised DPR for Rolep HEP.
    * ATPL did not fulfill essential obligations under the Second Agreement, making the termination by SoS justified.
    * The Sole Arbitrator's award was patently illegal on the face of the award, as it exceeded the scope of the claims, misconstrued the contract, and made decisions based on non-application of mind.
    * The court emphasized the need for a judicial approach in reviewing an arbitral award and the limited grounds for interference under section 34 of the Arbitration Act.

* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The court interpreted the relevant provisions of the Arbitration Act, Specific Relief Act, Indian Contract Act, and the Constitution of India in relation to the specific issues of the case.
    * The court relied on various precedents to determine the scope of public policy, the requirements for specific performance, the validity of contract modifications, and the limitations of judicial intervention in arbitral awards.
    * The court considered the language and intention of the Second Agreement, the minutes of the meetings, and the parties' pleadings to reach its conclusions.
