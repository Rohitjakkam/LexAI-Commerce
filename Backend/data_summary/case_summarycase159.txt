    * **Time Limitation:** A time limit set by law for taking legal action.

## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Appellant's Arguments:**
    * The Facilitation Council was improperly constituted as it had 9 members, violating Section 21 of the MSMED Act which mandates a maximum of 5 members.
    * This violation renders the award a nullity.
    * The Appellant was not aware of the violation until recently, as they did not receive the complete order sheet of the Facilitation Council proceedings.
    * The Appellant was not precluded from challenging the composition of the Council at this stage, as it goes to the root of the tribunal's jurisdiction.
    * The Appellant was not required to challenge the award under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act within the prescribed time limit because the LPA court had granted them liberty to do so.

* **Respondent's Arguments:**
    * The Facilitation Council is an arbitral tribunal under Section 7(1) of the Arbitration Act and therefore Section 16 applies, allowing it to rule on its own jurisdiction.
    * The Appellant could have challenged the composition of the Facilitation Council before the Council but failed to do so.
    * By not challenging the composition earlier, the Appellant waived its right to do so later.
    * The Appellant's challenge to the award under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act was time-barred, as the prescribed time limit had already elapsed when the Appellant initially challenged the award in the first writ petition.

## 5. Court's Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * Section 16 of the Arbitration Act applies to the arbitral proceedings before the Facilitation Council.
    * While the Facilitation Council was improperly constituted, the Appellant waived its right to challenge this by not raising the issue before the Council.
    * The Appellant's challenge to the award under Section 34 was time-barred, as the initial writ petition challenging the award was filed after the time limit for filing under Section 34 had expired.

* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The Court interpreted the Gujarat State Civil Supplies Corporation case to find that Section 16 of the Arbitration Act applies to the Facilitation Council.
    * The Court interpreted the Indian Farmers Fertilizer Cooperative Limited case to identify the three aspects of jurisdiction under Section 16.
    * The Court interpreted the Simplex Infrastructure Limited case to reaffirm the strict time limitation for challenging awards under Section 34.

* **Application of Law:**
    * The Court applied the Kompetenz principle and found that the Facilitation Council, being an arbitral tribunal, had the power to rule on its own jurisdiction.
    * The Court applied the doctrine of waiver and found that the Appellant had waived its right to challenge the composition of the Facilitation Council by not raising the issue before the Council.
    * The Court applied the time limitation provisions of Section 34 and found that the Appellant's challenge to the award under Section 34 was time-barred.

## 6. Judgment

* **Final Decision:** The appeal was dismissed.
* **Relief Granted:** No relief was granted to the Appellant.
* **Orders:** The impugned orders passed by the lower courts were upheld.

## 7. Implications

* **Impact on Law:** The judgment reinforces the applicability of the Arbitration Act to proceedings before Facilitation Councils under the MSMED Act. It also reemphasizes the importance of raising objections to the composition of an arbitral tribunal before the tribunal itself and the strict time limit for challenging arbitral awards under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act.
* **Future Relevance:** The case will be highly relevant in future cases involving disputes arising under the MSMED Act, particularly regarding the jurisdiction and composition of Facilitation Councils and the time limitation for challenging arbitral awards.
* **Broader Context:** The judgment reflects the importance of adhering to legal timelines in dispute resolution and the need for parties to raise objections at the appropriate stage.
