## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Plaintiff’s Argument (Respondent):**
    * The dispute was a "commercial dispute" as defined under Section 2(1)(c)(vii) of the Commercial Courts Act because the property was used for educational purposes, which falls under the category of "other institutions" as defined by BBMP Bye-laws. 
    * The transaction between the parties was a commercial one, exceeding Rs. 1 crore in value.
    * The Petitioner's default in paying full rent at the agreed rate constituted a breach of the lease agreement, justifying eviction and recovery of rent arrears.

    * The dispute did not constitute a "commercial dispute" because the property was used exclusively for educational purposes, not for trade or commerce. 
    * The Petitioner was running a school as a charitable activity, not for profit.
    * The expression "used exclusively in trade or commerce" should be interpreted strictly, excluding educational institutions.
