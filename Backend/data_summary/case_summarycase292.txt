    * The respondent's conduct violated the SHA's non-competitive clauses, and his actions should be restrained.
    * The commercial court's order granting an unconditional stay of the interim award violated Section 36(2) of the Arbitration Act.
    * The commercial court was not required to grant an unconditional stay without proper grounds under the Arbitration Act.

* **Respondent’s Argument:**
    * The SHA did not contain non-competitive clauses, and his actions were not in breach of the agreement.
    * The interim award was patently illegal, as it erroneously interpreted the SHA and imposed non-competitive obligations.
    * The commercial court was justified in staying the award as it was necessary to ensure the validity of the petition under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The court found that the commercial court's order granting an unconditional stay of the interim award was not in accordance with the provisions of Section 36(2) of the Arbitration Act.
    * The court observed that the commercial court failed to consider the provisions for granting stay under the Arbitration Act and disregarded the provisions for imposing conditions as stipulated in Section 36(3).
    * The court held that the commercial court's order was also not in consonance with the previous order passed by the High Court in CR No. 4003 of 2022, which had directed the commercial court to decide the application under Section 36 of the Arbitration Act in accordance with law.

* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The court interpreted the provisions of Section 36(2) and (3) of the Arbitration Act to emphasize that the court has the discretion to grant stay of an award subject to conditions and that it can only grant unconditional stay if it is satisfied that there is a prima facie case of fraud or corruption in the arbitration agreement or the award.
    * The court also interpreted the precedents regarding the application of the Arbitration Act to government entities to emphasize that there is no special treatment for government entities in this context.

* **Application of Law:**
    * The court applied the legal principles regarding the grant of stay of an award to the specific facts of the case, finding that the commercial court failed to follow the proper legal framework. 
    * The court also considered the arguments regarding the maintainability of the revision petition and found that it was maintainable in this instance.

## 6. Judgment

* **Final Decision:** The High Court set aside the impugned order dated 21.10.2022 passed by the commercial court.
