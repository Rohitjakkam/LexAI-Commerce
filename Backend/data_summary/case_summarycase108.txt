The Appellants and Respondent entered into a lease and development agreement in 2010 and 2011 respectively, under a 'Build, Operate, and Transfer' (BOT) model.

## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Appellant's Argument:**
    * They contended that the Respondent's termination of the agreements was arbitrary and unjustified, leading to the 'nil' Award. 
    * They argued that the delays in the project were due to the Respondent's actions and not their own.
    * They claimed to be in possession of the project site pursuant to the agreements and had invested significantly in the project.
    * They argued that the Respondent's forceful attempt to take possession of the site was unlawful and would cause irreparable harm to their investments.
    * They argued that they should be granted an injunction under Section 9 of the Act of 1996 to protect their possession pending the outcome of the petitions filed under Section 34 of the Act of 1996 to set aside the 'nil' Award. 
* **Respondent's Argument:**
    * They asserted that the Appellants had breached the agreements, leading to their termination.
    * They argued that the Appellants had failed to complete the project within the stipulated timeline and were in default of payment.
    * They claimed that they had lawfully taken possession of the project site on 19th December 2018.
    * They argued that the Appellants' petition under Section 9 of the Act of 1996 was not maintainable because they had lost the arbitration proceedings and there was no enforceable award in their favour.
    * They claimed that the balance of convenience favored them, as granting an injunction would prevent them from completing the project and causing them financial losses.

## 5. Court's Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The Court determined that the Appellants' petition under Section 9 of the Act of 1996 was maintainable, rejecting the argument that an unsuccessful party in arbitration cannot seek such relief.
    * The Court clarified that a Court's power under Section 34 of the Act of 1996 is not limited to simply setting aside an award but can also extend to modifying the award if necessary.
    * The Court found the Respondent's claim of lawfully taking possession on 19th December 2018 to be invalid, as it occurred before the expiration of the period for filing a petition under Section 34 of the Act of 1996. 
    * The Court considered the 'No Objection Certificate' issued by the Respondent allowing the Appellants to create a charge on the leasehold rights, indicating a prima facie case for the Appellants.
    * The Court held that the balance of convenience favored the Appellants due to their significant investments in the project and the potential irreparable harm they could suffer if a third party was brought in to complete the project.
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The Court interpreted Section 9 of the Act of 1996 to allow both winning and losing parties in arbitration to seek interim relief. 
    * The Court recognized the Court's power under Section 34 of the Act of 1996 to modify arbitral awards, citing various precedents.
    * The Court emphasized that the Respondent's action of taking possession before the expiration of the period for filing a petition under Section 34 was not legally sound. 
* **Application of Law:**
    * The Court applied the principles of granting interim injunctions based on prima facie case, balance of convenience, and irreparable injury. 
    * The Court analyzed the facts of the case and concluded that the Appellants had established all three elements necessary for granting interim protection.
