## 4. Arguments Presented

    * The unauthorized use constituted copyright infringement, causing financial loss to MRT Music.

    * The trial court's ex-parte order was illegal and procedurally flawed, as it was granted without proper notice and reasons.
    * The injunction was disproportionate to the alleged infringement, as it effectively removed the defendants from social media platforms.
    * The music clip was only 45 seconds long and used non-commercially in a political context.
    * The suit was motivated by ulterior motives and the plaintiff had delayed filing the lawsuit.
    * The injunction violated the defendants' right to freedom of expression guaranteed under the Constitution.
