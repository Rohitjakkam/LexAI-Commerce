## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Appellant’s Argument:**
    * The Commercial Court lacked jurisdiction to hear the case due to the applicability of the Maharashtra Rent Control Act, 1999.
    * The suit was defective due to non-compliance with Section 12-A of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 regarding pre-institution mediation.
    * The granting of an interim mandatory injunction by the Commercial Court was a final relief inappropriately granted at the interim stage.
    * The suit was barred by limitation under the Limitation Act, 1963.
* **Respondent’s Argument:**
    * The Commercial Court was the proper forum to hear the case given the commercial nature of the dispute and the Appellant's share capital exceeding Rs. 2 Crore.
    * The Appellant's objections regarding the application of the Maharashtra Rent Control Act and the requirement of pre-institution mediation were not raised in the trial court and were therefore waived.
    * The granting of the interim mandatory injunction was justified because the Appellant was illegally occupying the premises, accruing profits while failing to pay dues.
    * The suit was not barred by the law of limitation as it was not seeking a mandatory injunction within the meaning of Article 113 of the Limitation Act.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The Court found the Commercial Court had jurisdiction to hear the case as the dispute was commercial in nature and the Maharashtra Rent Control Act did not apply.
    * The Court ruled that Section 12-A of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 regarding pre-institution mediation was directory, not mandatory, and that the Appellant had waived the argument by not raising it before the trial court.
    * The Court held that the granting of the interim mandatory injunction was inappropriate because it constituted a final relief at the interim stage, especially considering triable issues and the Appellant's continued possession of the property.
    * The Court found that the suit was not barred by limitation because it was not for mandatory injunction and Article 113 of the Limitation Act was not applicable.
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The Court interpreted Section 2, 3, 11, and 12-A of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 in conjunction with the Maharashtra Rent Control Act, 1999 to determine jurisdiction and the requirement for pre-institution mediation.
    * The Court analyzed the relevant provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure and the Specific Relief Act to determine the appropriate circumstances for granting an interim mandatory injunction.
    * The Court applied Article 113 of the Limitation Act to the facts of the case to assess whether the suit was barred by limitation.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The Court applied the legal principles of jurisdiction, maintainability, pre-institution mediation, interim injunction, and limitation to the specific facts of the dispute between the parties.
    * The Court considered the Appellant's share capital, the nature of the leave and licence agreement, and the Appellant's continued possession of the property in determining the applicability of the Maharashtra Rent Control Act. 
    * The Court balanced the rights of both parties, considering the Appellant's renovation expenses and the Respondent's entitlement to licence fees.
