## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Petitioner’s Argument (ESL):**
    * The JHMSEFC was constituted in violation of Section 21 of the MSMED Act, which specifies a minimum of three and a maximum of five members.
    * The 2007 Rules, which formed the basis of the Council's constitution, were ultra vires the MSMED Act, as they allowed for a larger number of members.
    * The impugned award and notices issued by the JHMSEFC were therefore void ab initio.
    * The de facto doctrine did not apply in this case, as there was an express provision in the Arbitration Act for setting aside awards where the arbitral tribunal was improperly constituted.
    * The alternative remedy under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act was not effective and efficacious, as the Commercial Court would be bound by the 2007 Rules and unable to address the vires issue.
    * Challenging the award and notices through a writ petition was the only effective remedy available.

* **Respondent’s Argument (State of Jharkhand):**
    * The writ petitions were not maintainable because an alternative remedy under the Arbitration Act existed.
    * The 2007 Rules had been repealed and replaced by the 2017 Rules, which were in accordance with the MSMED Act.
    * The de facto doctrine applied, and the JHMSEFC was considered validly constituted despite exceeding the membership limit, as the minimum requirement was fulfilled.
    * The impugned award and notices were not void ab initio and could be challenged under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act.
    * The High Court should not interfere with the arbitral tribunal's decisions during the arbitration process.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * Section 21 of the MSMED Act clearly specifies the maximum number of members for the Micro and Small Enterprises Facilitation Council as five.
    * The 2007 Rules were ultra vires the MSMED Act as they allowed for a larger number of members.
    * The JHMSEFC, constituted under the 2007 Rules, was therefore illegally formed.
    * The de facto doctrine did not apply in this case, as it was a matter of substantive jurisdiction.
    * The alternative remedy under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act was not effective in this case, as the Commercial Court would be unable to address the vires issue.

* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The court strictly interpreted Section 21 of the MSMED Act and held that the maximum membership limit of five was mandatory.
    * The court considered the de facto doctrine, but found it inapplicable to cases involving a lack of substantive jurisdiction.
    * The court recognized that the alternative remedy under the Arbitration Act could not be considered effective if it failed to address the core issue of the JHMSEFC's illegal constitution.

* **Application of Law:**
    * The court applied the ultra vires doctrine to invalidate the 2007 Rules, thereby rendering the JHMSEFC's constitution illegal.
    * The court accepted that the impugned award and notices issued by the illegally constituted JHMSEFC were void ab initio.
    * The court exercised its jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution to address the issue of lack of jurisdiction, despite the availability of an alternative remedy under the Arbitration Act.

## 6. Judgment

* **Final Decision:**
    * The writ petitions were allowed.
* **Relief Granted:**
    * The impugned award communicated to the petitioner under Memo No. 1954 dated 20.07.2015 and the notices dated 31.01.2017 and 15.03.2017 were quashed.
* **Orders:**
    * The Council, constituted under the 2017 Rules, was allowed to issue fresh notices to the petitioner and adjudicate the matter afresh by passing a fresh award in accordance with law.

## 7. Implications
