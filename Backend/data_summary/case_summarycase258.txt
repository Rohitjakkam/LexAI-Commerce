## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Plaintiff’s Argument:**
    * Bhowmik argued that the dispute arose from the Dealership Agreement and involved issues beyond the scope of the arbitration clause.

    * Bhowmik argued that the arbitration proceedings initiated before the Calcutta High Court were not binding on him, as the suit was filed prior to the arbitration application.

* **Defendant’s Argument:**
    * Indorama argued that the dispute was clearly subject to the arbitration clause in the Dealership Agreement, which required the parties to resolve disputes through arbitration.
    * Indorama argued that the Commercial Court was not properly apprised of the fact that an arbitration proceeding had been initiated in the Calcutta High Court.

    * The Tripura High Court acknowledged the appointment of an arbitrator by the Calcutta High Court in arbitration application No. 325/21.
    * The Court noted that the dispute centered around the Dealership Agreement and involved issues that were within the scope of the arbitration clause.
    * The Court found that the Commercial Court had failed to exercise its jurisdiction under Section 8(1) of the Act by not referring the parties to arbitration.

    * The Court applied the principles of arbitration law, specifically the provisions of the Act, to the facts of the case.
