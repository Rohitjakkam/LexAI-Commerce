##  1. Case Title

* **Case Name:** National Highway Authority of India vs. Smt. Sampata Devi and 2 Others
* **Court:** Allahabad High Court, Lucknow Bench
* **Date of Judgment:** 31st October 2023
* **Citation:** 2023:AHC-LKO:71310

## 2. Background and Context

**Brief Overview:** 
This case involves multiple appeals filed by the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) challenging a judgment of the Additional District & Sessions Judge, Barabanki. The judgment upheld an arbitral award that had increased compensation awarded to various landowners whose land was acquired for the construction of National Highway No. 28. The NHAI argued that the arbitral award and subsequent judgment were contrary to law and that the compensation should have been determined based on the agricultural value of the land.

**Key Issues:**
* Whether the arbitral award, which granted enhanced compensation based on the land's proximity to the highway and potential for commercial development, was valid.
* Whether the NHAI's appeal against the judgment was filed within the statutory limitation period.

**Legal Doctrines:**

* Sufficient Cause for Delay: The court examined the NHAI's explanation for the delay in filing appeals and determined whether it constituted 'sufficient cause' for condoning the delay as per Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963.
* Public Interest: The court considered the NHAI's argument that as a public body engaged in road construction for public benefit, they should be given special consideration.

## 4. Arguments Presented

**Plaintiff's Argument (Respondent):**
* The respondent landowners argued that their land was adjacent to the highway and had a commercial value exceeding the agricultural value.
* They claimed that the arbitral award, which considered the location and potential for commercial development, was a fair assessment of their compensation.
* They argued that the NHAI's appeal against the judgment was filed with inordinate delay and that they were entitled to rely on the judgment and the arbitral award.

**Defendant's Argument (Appellant):**
* The NHAI argued that the arbitral award was illegal as it disregarded the prescribed method of calculating compensation based on agricultural land value.
* They contended that the land should have been valued as agricultural land, as its commercial potential was not established at the time of acquisition.
* They claimed that their delay in filing the appeal was due to procedural delays in obtaining internal approvals, including seeking legal advice and obtaining approval from the regional office.

## 5. Court's Analysis and Reasoning

**Key Findings:**
* The court noted that the NHAI had initially accepted the original compensation award determined by the Prescribed Authority, and the landowners had received and enjoyed the compensation for five years without protest.
* The court acknowledged that the NHAI's internal procedural delays might have contributed to the delay in filing the appeals but concluded that the delay was beyond the acceptable time limit for condonation under the Limitation Act.
* The court observed that the NHAI's explanation for the delay did not constitute sufficient cause as defined by the relevant precedents.

**Interpretation of Law:**
* The court analyzed and interpreted the various relevant Acts, including the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, the Limitation Act, 1963, and the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, to determine the applicable limitation period for filing appeals under Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.
* The court clarified that the limitation period for such appeals is 60 days, as per Section 13(1A) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, in cases where the commercial dispute value exceeds INR 3,00,000.00.

**Application of Law:**
* The court applied the legal precedents, particularly those established in M/s Borse Brothers Engineers & Contractors (supra), to determine that even though the NHAI was a public body, they were not exempt from the limitation period for filing appeals.
* The court also applied the principle of 'sufficient cause' as outlined in the Limitation Act, 1963, and held that the NHAI's explanation for the delay did not meet the standard required for condoning the delay.

## 6. Judgment

**Final Decision:**
The Allahabad High Court dismissed all the appeals filed by the National Highway Authority of India on the grounds of limitation.

**Relief Granted:**
No relief was granted to the NHAI.

**Orders:**

## 7. Implications
