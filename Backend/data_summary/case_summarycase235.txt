##  1. Case Title

•	**Case Name:** Shapoorji Pallonji And Co. Pvt. Ltd vs Gujarat State Electricity Corporation Ltd.
•	**Court:** Gujarat High Court
•	**Date of Judgment:** 1st July 2023
•	**Citation:** C/SCA/9590/2023

## 2. Background and Context

•	**Brief Overview:** This case stemmed from a dispute between Shapoorji Pallonji And Co. Pvt. Ltd. (the petitioner) and Gujarat State Electricity Corporation Ltd. (the respondent) arising from a contract for construction work at a Lignite Thermal Power Plan in Bhavnagar. The petitioner, after completing the work, claimed payment from the respondent, which was refused. This led to arbitration proceedings where the petitioner was awarded a substantial amount. The respondent challenged the award, leading to a stay order by the Additional District Judge, Bhavnagar - Commercial Court, which ordered the respondent to deposit 50% of the principal amount awarded. The petitioner challenged this order in the Gujarat High Court, seeking modification to require the respondent to deposit the entire awarded amount, including interest and costs.

•	**Key Issues:**
    * Whether the Gujarat High Court could exercise jurisdiction under Article 227 of the Constitution to modify the order passed by the Commercial Court under Section 36 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.
    * Whether the Commercial Court erred in only directing the respondent to deposit 50% of the principal amount awarded while granting a stay on the operation of the arbitral award.
    * Whether the respondent, a semi-governmental corporation, was exempt from depositing the full awarded amount, including interest and costs, under Order 27 Rule 8A of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.

## 4. Arguments Presented

•	**Petitioner's Argument:** 
    * The Commercial Court's order was erroneous and against the intention of the legislature behind amending Section 36 of the Arbitration Act in 2015.
    * The Court failed to consider the interest and costs awarded in the arbitral award, which were integral parts of the total awarded amount.
    * The respondent should have been required to deposit the entire awarded amount as a condition for stay of the award.
    * Relying on the Supreme Court's decision in *Manish vs. Godawari Marathawada Irrigation Development Corporation*, the petitioner argued for a 100% deposit.

•	**Respondent's Argument:** 
    * The order passed by the Commercial Court was just and proper, safeguarding the petitioner's awarded amount while the challenge to the award was pending.
    * The petitioner was seeking to withdraw the amount before the final adjudication of proceedings under Section 34, and the remedy of appeal under Section 37 was available.
    * Citing Order 27 Rule 8A of the CPC, the respondent argued that, as a semi-governmental corporation, it was exempt from the mandatory requirement of depositing the full decretal amount.
    * The respondent relied on the Full Bench of the Calcutta High Court judgment in *Union of India vs. Amitava Paul* to support their argument regarding the exemption.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

•	**Key Findings:**
    * The Court rejected the preliminary objection regarding the maintainability of the petition under Article 227 of the Constitution. 
    * The Court found that the Commercial Court's order was erroneous in not directing the respondent to deposit the interest and cost awarded by the Arbitral Tribunal.
    * The Court emphasized that an arbitral award for payment of money, akin to a money decree, necessitates the deposit of the entire awarded amount, including interest and costs, as a condition for staying the award.
    * The Court rejected the respondent's reliance on Order 27 Rule 8A of the CPC, emphasizing that the Arbitration Act, being a special Act, takes precedence and mandates equal treatment of all parties, including the government.

•	**Interpretation of Law:**
    * The Court interpreted Section 36 of the Arbitration Act to mandate the deposit of the awarded amount, including interest and costs, as a condition for stay, unless there were exceptional circumstances, such as fraud or corruption, which were absent in this case.
    * The Court interpreted the relevant provisions of the CPC to clarify that Order 27 Rule 8A only exempts the government from furnishing security and does not exempt it from depositing the awarded amount.

•	**Application of Law:**
    * The Court applied the principles of equity and balance of equities between the parties, considering that the petitioner had substantially succeeded in the arbitration proceedings.
    * The Court applied the principle of special legislation prevailing over general legislation, noting the specific provisions of the Arbitration Act concerning the enforcement and stay of arbitral awards.

## 6. Judgment

•	**Final Decision:** The Gujarat High Court allowed the petitioner's Special Civil Application and modified the Commercial Court's order.
