**4. Arguments Presented**

* **Plaintiff’s Argument:**
    * The plaintiff was the registered proprietor of the trademarks "RELIANCE" and "RELIANCE Rx" logo, and had a statutory right to use them exclusively.
    * The defendant's use of similar names and logos constituted trademark infringement and passing off, as it was likely to cause confusion among consumers.
    * The defendant's use of the word "RELIANCE" was dishonest and intended to exploit the plaintiff's goodwill.
* **Defendant’s Argument:**
    * The word "RELIANCE" was a common, generic term, and the plaintiff could not claim exclusive rights to it simply because it was registered.
    * The plaintiff's reliance on the goodwill of the Ambani's "Reliance" company was improper, as it had no right to exploit someone else's goodwill.
    * The defendant had been using the name "Reliance Medipharma" since 2011, and the plaintiff was aware of their activities.
    * The plaintiff's claim of passing off was weak, as the pharmaceutical products were prescription drugs, and consumers were unlikely to be confused.
    * The plaintiff's application for injunction was not merited, as they had not proven a clear case of infringement or passing off.

**5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning**

* **Key Findings:**
    * The court noted that the plaintiff had not pressed the claim of passing off and was primarily focused on the use of the word "RELIANCE" and the "RELIANCE Rx" logo.
    * The court found that the word "RELIANCE" was a generic and common word in usage, and could not be exclusively claimed as a trademark.
    * The court considered the arguments regarding the plaintiff's prior use and the defendant's use of similar trademarks but concluded that the plaintiff was not entitled to injunction solely based on the registration of the generic term "RELIANCE".
    * The court accepted the defendant's statement that they would not use the "Reliance Rx.M" logo or "Reliance Rx M" label with respect to pharmaceutical products.
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The court interpreted the relevant provisions of the Trade Marks Act, 1999, particularly Section 2(1)(v), Section 28, Section 29, Section 31, and Section 17(2), to determine the rights of the registered proprietor.
    * The court referred to various precedents cited by both parties and applied the legal doctrines of trademark infringement, passing off, and publici juris to the facts of the case.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The court applied the principles of trademark law to the case, recognizing that generic terms cannot be exclusively claimed as trademarks.
    * The court considered the fact that the plaintiff had not pressed its claim of passing off and that the defendant had agreed not to use the specific logos in question.

**6. Judgment**

* **Final Decision:** The appeals were partly allowed.
* **Relief Granted:** The impugned orders passed by the learned Judge, Commercial Court, Vadodara, were modified to the extent that the defendants were restrained from using the "Reliance Rx M" logo or "Reliance Rx M" label with respect to pharmaceutical products. The rest of the order refusing to grant injunction against the defendants restraining them from using the name "Reliance" was confirmed.
* **Orders:** The court directed the parties to maintain the interim arrangement in place until 09.07.2018.

**7. Implications**

* **Impact on Law:** The judgment reaffirms the principle that generic terms cannot be exclusively claimed as trademarks. It highlights the importance of considering the nature of the trademark in question, particularly when it involves common or descriptive words.
* **Future Relevance:** The case serves as a precedent for future cases involving trademark disputes involving generic terms. It emphasizes the need for a plaintiff to demonstrate a clear case of infringement or passing off when seeking injunctions against the use of common words.
* **Broader Context:** The judgment reflects the ongoing challenges of protecting trademarks in a digital age, where businesses are increasingly competing for attention and consumers are exposed to a wide range of brands and products.

**8. Summary Points**

* The court found that the word "RELIANCE" was a common and generic term and could not be exclusively claimed by the plaintiff.
