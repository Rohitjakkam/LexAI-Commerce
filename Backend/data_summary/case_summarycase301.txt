## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Petitioner’s Argument:**
    * Section 6 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, does not grant jurisdiction to commercial courts to handle execution petitions.
    * Execution powers are not included in the provisions of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, and are governed by Sections 36 to 74 and Order XXI of the CPC.
    * The dispute did not qualify as a "commercial claim" and, therefore, the English Commercial Court lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate the matter.
    * The execution proceedings were a separate and independent process, distinct from the adjudication of the original dispute.
* **Respondent’s Argument:**
    * The petitioner had engaged in dilatory tactics to avoid honoring the English Commercial Court's decree.
    * The dispute involved a maritime claim, which is a commercial dispute under the definition in the Commercial Courts Act, 2015.
    * The Commercial Court in Rajkot (now Jamnagar) had inherent jurisdiction to try and decide the execution petition as it was a commercial dispute.
    * The petitioner had already challenged the jurisdiction of the Commercial Court in previous litigation, which was dismissed by the Gujarat High Court.

    * The execution proceedings are an extension of the original commercial dispute and fall under the jurisdiction of the Commercial Court.
    * The petitioner's repeated attempts to challenge the jurisdiction of the Commercial Court are an abuse of process of law.
