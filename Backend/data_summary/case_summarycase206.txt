    * None of the conditions stipulated under Section 37 of the Act for appealability were met.
    * The order was also not appealable under Section 13(1-A) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 because it was not specifically enumerated under Order XLIII of the CPC.

    * The petition under Article 227 is not maintainable because the order was appealable under Section 13(1-A) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015.
    * The Commercial Court was functioning at the level of a District Judge, and the order passed was related to an execution proceeding.
    * The absence of conditions specified under Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 did not preclude the appealability under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015.

## 5. Court's Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The court emphasized the specific purpose of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 to expedite the disposal of commercial disputes.
    * The court interpreted the non-obstante clause in Section 13(2) of the Act as explicitly barring any other form of appeal, including those under Article 227 of the Constitution or Section 115 of the CPC.
    * The court found that the order passed by the Commercial Court was appealable under Section 13(1-A) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, as it was issued in an execution proceeding by a Commercial Court at the level of a District Judge. 
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The court interpreted the scope of Article 227 and Section 115 of the CPC in light of the amendments made in 2002. It concluded that these provisions primarily serve to correct jurisdictional errors and are not meant for reviewing interlocutory orders.
    * The court carefully analyzed the interplay between the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, and the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, to determine the appropriate appellate forum.
    * The court considered the precedent set in Kandla Export Corporation v. OCI Corporation, where the Supreme Court held that appeals under Section 13(1) of the Commercial Courts Act were limited to orders specifically enumerated under Order 43 of the CPC and Section 37 of the Arbitration Act. 
* **Application of Law:**
    * The court applied the principles established in Deep Industries Limited v. Oil and Natural gas Corporation Limited, wherein the Supreme Court clarified that petitions under Article 227 are maintainable only when the impugned order suffers from jurisdictional errors. 
    * The court concluded that the petitioner's grievance in this case did not constitute a jurisdictional error, but rather an issue of disagreement with the order's content.
    * The court determined that the petitioner's recourse lay within the framework of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, through an appeal under Section 13(1-A).

The court's careful analysis of the purpose behind the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, demonstrates the need to consider the underlying objectives of statutory provisions while resolving legal disputes.
