## Arguments Presented

* **Plaintiff’s Argument (Madhanraj HUF and B. Niranjani):**
    * The transactions involving the lending and borrowing of money were commercial in nature, involving licensed money lenders and business loans.
    * The Promissory notes and communication between the parties clearly demonstrate a commercial transaction.
    * The Commercial Courts Act, 2015 applies, granting the Commercial Court jurisdiction to hear the cases.
    * The requirement of pre-institution mediation under Section 12-A is procedural and can be cured even during the pendency of the suit.
    * The defendant's arguments regarding lack of jurisdiction and maintainability are baseless and should be rejected.
* **Defendant’s Argument (Radha @ Radha Ramalingam):**
    * The Commercial Courts Act, 2015 is not intended to apply to ordinary money claims arising from promissory notes.
    * The transactions lack a commercial flavour and do not fall under the definition of "commercial dispute" under the Act.
    * The promissory notes are not "mercantile documents" as defined in the Act, which is a necessary condition for invoking the Act's jurisdiction.
    * The Commercial Court lacked jurisdiction to hear the cases and the suits should be dismissed.
    * The mandatory provision of pre-institution mediation under Section 12-A was not complied with, rendering the suits non-maintainable.
    * The trial court erred in allowing the amendment of the plaint and accepting a delayed statement of truth, which violated procedural rules.
