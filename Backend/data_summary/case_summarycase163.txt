* **Court:** Gujarat High Court
* **Date of Judgment:** 22nd September 2023
* **Citation:** C/SCA/5509/2021 

## 2. Background and Context

**Brief Overview:** This case involves the enforcement of a foreign judgment and decree passed by the High Court of Justice, Queens' Bench, Commercial Court of London, against Arun Kumar Jagatramka (petitioner), who had issued a personal guarantee on behalf of Gujarat (NRE) Coke Limited to Ultrabulk A/S (respondent) for a debt of USD 4,259,395.  When Ultrabulk A/S sought to execute the decree in India, Jagatramka objected, claiming the foreign judgment was not conclusive and the guarantee was not enforceable in India.

**Key Issues:**

* **Enforceability of Foreign Judgment:** Whether the foreign judgment and decree are conclusive and enforceable in India under Section 44A of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (CPC).
* **Compliance with Section 13 CPC:**  Whether the foreign judgment meets the requirements of Section 13 CPC, which outlines exceptions to the conclusiveness of foreign judgments.
* **Personal Guarantee and On-Demand Bond:** Whether the personal guarantee issued by Jagatramka should be considered an on-demand bond, making him liable for the full amount regardless of payments made by Gujarat (NRE) Coke Limited.
* **Validity of Guarantee under FEMA:** Whether the personal guarantee issued without prior permission from the Reserve Bank of India violated the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) and Regulations.
* **Expert Witness Credibility:** Whether the respondent's expert witness, Mr. Amitava Majumdar, had a conflict of interest due to his previous representation of the respondent in another case.
* **Interim Moratorium and IBC:** Whether the personal insolvency proceedings initiated by the State Bank of India against Jagatramka under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC) automatically stayed the execution proceedings under Section 96 of the IBC.

## 4. Arguments Presented

**Plaintiff’s Argument (Arun Kumar Jagatramka):**

* **Lack of Jurisdiction:** The English Court lacked jurisdiction to pass the judgment as Jagatramka was not a resident of England, and the cause of action did not arise there.
* **Judgment not on Merits:** The judgment did not address Jagatramka's claim that the guarantee was not a primary liability but a secondary liability mirroring the principal debtor's liability. The English Court failed to properly apportion the payments made by Gujarat (NRE) Coke Limited.
* **Violation of Indian Law:** The guarantee was invalid because it was issued without prior permission from the Reserve Bank of India, in violation of the Foreign Exchange Management (Guarantees) (Regulations), 2000.  The English Court wrongly interpreted FEMA provisions.
* **Violation of Natural Justice:** Jagatramka was denied a fair opportunity to defend himself in the English Court when his request for video conferencing was denied.
* **Conflict of Interest:** The respondent's expert witness, Mr. Amitava Majumdar, had a conflict of interest because he previously represented the respondent in another case.  His opinion on Indian law was therefore not independent.
* **Automatic Moratorium under IBC:**  The personal insolvency proceedings initiated against Jagatramka under the IBC automatically imposed an interim moratorium, staying further proceedings in the execution petition.

**Defendant’s Argument (Ultrabulk A/S):**

* **Jurisdiction Established:** The guarantee explicitly stipulated English law and jurisdiction, and Jagatramka agreed not to contest jurisdiction.
* **Judgment on Merits:** The English Court carefully considered all relevant evidence and arguments, including Jagatramka's defenses, and arrived at a reasoned decision.
* **FEMA Compliance:**  The guarantee was not a violation of FEMA, as post-facto permission could be obtained. The English Court correctly interpreted FEMA.
* **No Conflict of Interest:** Mr. Majumdar disclosed his previous representation of the respondent, and Jagatramka did not object at the time. The English Court followed proper procedures for expert witness testimony.
* **No Automatic Moratorium:**  Jagatramka cannot benefit from the IBC proceedings while simultaneously challenging their validity. His conduct demonstrates waiver of his rights under Section 96 of the IBC.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

**Key Findings:**

* The Gujarat High Court upheld the lower court's decision that the foreign decree was enforceable in India under Section 44A of the CPC.
* The High Court found no merit in Jagatramka's arguments that the foreign judgment was not conclusive under Section 13 of the CPC.
* The Court determined that the personal guarantee was a primary liability and not a secondary one, making Jagatramka liable for the full amount, as the English Court had correctly interpreted the terms of the guarantee. 
* The Court rejected Jagatramka's arguments concerning FEMA violations, finding that the English Court had correctly interpreted the provisions of FEMA, and that the guarantee could be made valid by obtaining post-facto permission from the Reserve Bank of India.
* The Court dismissed Jagatramka's claim of conflict of interest with regard to the respondent's expert witness, noting the disclosure and Jagatramka's lack of objection at the time.
* Regarding the IBC proceedings, the Court found that Jagatramka's conduct, including his attempts to challenge the IBC provisions while simultaneously seeking protection under them, constituted waiver of his rights under Section 96 of the IBC.  The Court further ruled that the interim moratorium under the IBC could not be applied indefinitely.

**Interpretation of Law:**

* The High Court confirmed the applicability of Section 44A of the CPC for executing foreign decrees in India, emphasizing the need for due judicial process and reasonable opportunity for parties to be heard in the foreign court.
* The court carefully examined each exception outlined in Section 13 of the CPC and determined that Jagatramka's claims did not meet the requirements for any of them.
* The Court adopted a consistent interpretation of FEMA and its regulations, emphasizing that a post-facto permission could rectify any violation, and that the principle of "approbate and reprobate" prevented parties from taking advantage of their own wrongdoings.

**Application of Law:**

* The Court applied the legal principles of res judicata and constructive res judicata to Jagatramka's repeated challenges to the lower court's decisions, finding that he had already had the opportunity to raise his arguments in previous proceedings.
* The Court applied the doctrine of waiver to Jagatramka's attempt to benefit from the IBC proceedings while simultaneously challenging their validity. 
* The Court emphasized the need for prompt and expeditious resolution of insolvency proceedings under the IBC.

## 6. Judgment

* **Final Decision:** The Gujarat High Court dismissed all the petitions filed by Arun Kumar Jagatramka.
* **Relief Granted:** No specific relief was granted, as all the petitions were dismissed.
* **Orders:** 
    * The execution proceedings were to be decided by the Executing Court within three months from the date of receipt of the High Court's order.
    * The High Court rejected Jagatramka's request for a stay of the judgment and order.

## 7. Implications

**Impact on Law:**

* The judgment reaffirms the enforceability of foreign decrees in India under Section 44A of the CPC, provided that the foreign court followed due process and provided adequate opportunity for the parties to present their case.
* It provides a clearer understanding of the exceptions to the conclusiveness of foreign judgments under Section 13 of the CPC.
* The judgment reinforces the principles of waiver and "approbate and reprobate" in the context of challenging statutory provisions and seeking protection under them.

* It clarifies the interpretation of FEMA provisions in the context of personal guarantees.
* It guides courts in determining the applicability of the IBC moratorium in complex legal situations.
