## 4. Arguments Presented

* **DICDL's Argument:** DICDL argued that the dispute falls under the purview of the Act, 1992, which mandates the adjudication of disputes arising from works contracts with public undertakings by the GPWCDAT. DICDL contended that as a government company, it falls under the definition of a "public undertaking" under the Act, 1992. They argued that the Act, 1992 is a special legislation that overrides the general provisions of the Act, 1996. They further argued that the issue of jurisdiction should be decided as a preliminary issue to avoid unnecessary costs and delays. They sought to invoke Order XIV Rule 2 of the Code to frame the jurisdictional issue as a preliminary question. 
* **SPML's Argument:** SPML countered that DICDL had submitted to the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal by participating in the arbitration proceedings, including filing its Statement of Defense and counterclaim. They argued that DICDL's delay in raising the jurisdictional objection was not justified and amounted to a tactical maneuver to delay the proceedings. SPML claimed that DICDL was estopped from challenging the Arbitral Tribunal's jurisdiction at this stage. They argued that the Act, 1996 is a complete code that governs arbitration proceedings and is not bound by procedural rules of the Code. They emphasized that DICDL had not initiated any action under the Act, 1992 to refer the matter to the GPWCDAT, thereby opting for the arbitration proceedings under the Act, 1996. 

## 5. Court's Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The Arbitral Tribunal had left the issue of jurisdiction open to be decided with the other issues in the case, not as a preliminary issue.
    * DICDL had attempted to raise the jurisdictional objection under Section 16(2) of the Act, 1996 but failed, leading to the Tribunal rejecting their application.
    * DICDL's attempt to invoke Order XIV Rule 2 of the Code to revisit the jurisdiction issue was deemed to be an attempt to do indirectly what they could not do directly.
    * The court recognized the precedence of special legislation (Act, 1992) over general provisions (Act, 1996) in cases of works contracts involving public undertakings.
    * The court acknowledged that the Arbitral Tribunal had not foreclosed DICDL's right to raise the jurisdictional issue at the final hearing stage.
* **Interpretation of Law:** The court interpreted the Act, 1992, Act, 1996, and Order XIV Rule 2 of the Code in the context of the specific facts of the case. They emphasized the non-obstante clause in Section 5 of the Act, 1996, limiting judicial intervention in arbitration proceedings, and the specific provisions of Section 16(2) requiring timely raising of jurisdictional objections. The court recognized the precedence of special legislation over general legislation based on the principle of generalia specialibus non derogant. 
* **Application of Law:**  The court applied the legal principles to the specific facts of the case, finding that DICDL had already attempted to raise the jurisdiction issue under Section 16(2) of the Act, 1996, and failed. They also observed that the Arbitral Tribunal had left the jurisdictional issue open to be decided at the final hearing stage. Based on these findings, the court dismissed the petition, concluding that DICDL's attempt to revisit the jurisdiction issue through a petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India was not justified.

## 6. Judgment

## 7. Implications

* **Future Relevance:** The judgment provides a precedent for courts to be cautious in interfering with arbitration proceedings, particularly when the jurisdictional issue has already been addressed or is open to be decided at the final hearing stage.  
* **Broader Context:** The judgment highlights the challenges faced by public undertakings in navigating legal disputes with private contractors in the context of infrastructure projects. It underscores the importance of carefully drafting contracts and adhering to the specific provisions of applicable legislation.

## 8. Summary Points
