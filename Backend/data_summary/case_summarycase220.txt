**4. Arguments Presented**

* **Appellant’s Argument:**
    * The High Court, despite lacking jurisdiction, should transfer the case to the Commercial Court at Visakhapatnam using its power under Section 24 of CPC.
    * Filing a fresh appeal in the Commercial Court would cause significant delay and financial loss to the Appellant.
    * Section 24 (5) of CPC grants the High Court the power to transfer appeals from Courts without jurisdiction.
    * The term “proceeding” in Section 24 (3) and (5) of CPC should be interpreted broadly to include appeals.
    * The delay caused by the pending appeal before the High Court should be excluded from the limitation period under the Arbitration Act.
* **Respondent’s Argument:**
    * Section 24 of CPC only allows transfer of suits, appeals, or proceedings from a competent Court.
    * Section 24 (5) specifically excludes appeals from being transferred from a Court without jurisdiction.
    * The term “proceeding” in Section 24 (5) refers only to original proceedings, not appeals.
    * The absence of the term “appeal” in Section 24 (5) is not a mere oversight but a deliberate exclusion.
    * The Appellant had four days to file an appeal in the Commercial Court after the High Court declared lack of jurisdiction, but failed to do so.
    * Applications under Section 24 of CPC can only be filed before a single judge, not a Division Bench.

**5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning**

* **Key Findings:**
    * The High Court recognized that it lacked jurisdiction to entertain the appeal.
    * The court reviewed the relevant sections of the CPC and analyzed the arguments of both parties.
    * The court considered the precedent set by the Kerala High Court in Cholasseri Hamza and Ors. Vs. T.V. Udayaraj, which favored the Appellant's argument regarding transfer of appeals.
    * The court also examined the Supreme Court’s decision in Ram Chandra Aggarwal v. State of U.P., which defined the scope of "proceeding" as not including appeals.
    * The court addressed the applicability of Section 14 of the Limitation Act in relation to transfers under the Arbitration Act.
* **Interpretation of Law:**
    * The court interpreted Section 24 of CPC narrowly, focusing on the specific language used in the statute and the deliberate omission of “appeal” in Section 24 (5).
    * The court relied on the Supreme Court's interpretation of "proceeding" in Ram Chandra Aggarwal v. State of U.P. to exclude appeals from the scope of Section 24 (5) of CPC.
* **Application of Law:**
    * The court applied the strict interpretation of Section 24 of CPC to the present case, concluding that the transfer of the appeal was not permissible.
