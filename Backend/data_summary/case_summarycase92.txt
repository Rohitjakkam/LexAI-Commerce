## Arguments Presented

**Plaintiff’s Argument:**

* **Maintainability:**  The Plaintiffs argued that the orders dismissing their applications under Order XII Rule 6 and Order VIII Rule 10 were not merely interlocutory, but affected their substantive rights and were therefore revisable under Section 115 of the CPC.
* **Order XII Rule 6:** The Plaintiffs asserted that the Defendant’s written statement failed to deny all the allegations in the plaint, leading to an admission that warranted a decree under Order XII Rule 6.
* **Order VIII Rule 10:** The Plaintiffs claimed that the Defendant’s written statement was not filed within the time limit stipulated under Order VIII Rule 10 of the CPC and did not comply with the provisions of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015.

**Defendant’s Argument:**

* **Maintainability:** The Defendant argued that the orders were interlocutory and therefore not revisable under Section 115 of the CPC, citing Section 8 and Section 12(3) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, and the precedents of HPL (India) Limited and Tek Singh v. Shashi Verma.
* **Order XII Rule 6:** The Defendant contended that its written statement denied all the allegations and did not constitute an admission justifying a decree under Order XII Rule 6.
* **Order VIII Rule 10:** The Defendant argued that its written statement was filed within the stipulated time frame and that any minor procedural defects could be rectified.

## Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

**Key Findings:**

* The Delhi High Court relied heavily on the Division Bench judgment in Black Diamond Trackparts Pvt. Ltd. which held that revision petitions under Section 115 of the CPC are barred under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015.
* The Court recognized that the purpose of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 was to expedite commercial dispute resolution and that allowing revision petitions against interlocutory orders would defeat this purpose.

**Interpretation of Law:**

* The Court interpreted the provisions of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, particularly Section 8 and 12(3), to mean that revision petitions against interlocutory orders were explicitly barred.
* The Court further interpreted the precedents cited by the Defendant to support its position on the bar against revision petitions.

**Application of Law:**

* The Court applied the legal principle of legislative intent, concluding that the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 intended to streamline the process for resolving commercial disputes, thereby barring revision petitions against interlocutory orders.
* The Court applied the precedents cited, specifically Black Diamond Trackparts Pvt. Ltd., to affirm the non-maintainability of revision petitions under the Act.
