    * **Associate Builders vs. Delhi Development Authority reported in (2015) 3 SCC 49:** This case emphasized that the Court can only interfere with an arbitral award if it is arbitrary, capricious, perverse, or suffers from patent illegality.

    * **Patent Illegality:** Refers to an award that is clearly and demonstrably wrong or against the law.

## 4. Arguments Presented

* **Appellant's (EPIL) Argument:**
    * The arbitrator failed to specify the amount of the award, making it impossible to calculate the interest awarded.
    * The arbitrator traveled beyond the terms of the arbitration agreement by not hearing the Director of Agriculture, who was responsible for the project.
    * The arbitrator wrongly awarded damages to M/S. M. P. Khaitan, including those for escalation charges, longer retention of the work site, and illegal withholding of payments.

* **Respondent's (M/S. M. P. Khaitan) Argument:**
    * The arbitrator's award is well-founded and does not call for interference.
    * The arbitrator clearly specified the amount awarded under various heads.
    * The arbitrator properly considered the evidence and applied the law in deciding the issues.
    * The arguments raised by EPIL do not fall under the grounds for setting aside an arbitral award under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act.

## 5. Court's Analysis and Reasoning

* **Key Findings:**
    * The Court found that the arbitrator had specified the amounts awarded to M/S. M. P. Khaitan under various heads, contrary to EPIL's claim.
    * The Court held that the arbitrator's decision was not based on patent illegality, arbitrariness, or a violation of public policy.
    * The Court emphasized that it cannot sit in appeal and re-examine the arbitrator's findings on merit, as per the precedents cited.

* **Interpretation of Law:** 
    * The Court interpreted Section 34 of the Arbitration Act to limit the Court's power to interfere with arbitral awards only on specific grounds.
    * The Court applied the precedents established in the McDermott International INC and Associate Builders cases, which highlight the limited scope of judicial review of arbitral awards.

* **Application of Law:**
    * The Court concluded that EPIL's arguments did not meet the requirements for setting aside the arbitral award under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act.
    * The Court found that the arbitrator had followed the law, considered the evidence, and reached a well-reasoned decision.

## 7. Implications

* **Future Relevance:** This case provides a clear example of the Court's approach to challenges against arbitral awards, particularly in cases where the appellant argues that the arbitrator has failed to specify the amount of the award or has made a patently illegal decision.
