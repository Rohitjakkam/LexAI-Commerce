## 4. Arguments Presented

  *  **Univabs’ Argument:** 
    *  The Arbitrator was wrong in excluding Univabs’ additional claims from the scope of arbitration.
    *  The Arbitrator erred in finding that Univabs was not entitled to damages for the Union’s breach of contract.
    *  The Arbitrator's findings on specific claims, such as faulty price variation formula, VAT credit, and demurrage charges, were flawed.
    *  The Commercial Court should have modified the Award to award damages and adjudicate on the additional claims instead of simply setting aside the Award.
  *  **Union’s Argument:**
    *  The additional claims raised by Univabs were beyond the scope of the initial reference to arbitration.
    *  The Union did not breach the contract as its sole responsibility was to nominate cement suppliers, and it could not be held accountable for the supplier's failure to meet supply obligations.
    *  The Arbitrator correctly interpreted the contract terms and conditions regarding price variation formula, VAT credit, and demurrage charges.
    *  The Commercial Court was limited to setting aside the Award and could not modify or correct it.

## 5. Court’s Analysis and Reasoning

  *  **Key Findings:**
    *  The court held that the Arbitrator erred in excluding Univabs’ additional claims, relying on the precedent set in *Praveen Enterprises* (supra).
    *  The court concluded that the Arbitrator's finding on the Union's breach of contract was not perverse or illegal.
    *  The court found that the Arbitrator's decision on specific claims, such as faulty price variation formula, VAT credit, and demurrage charges, suffered from legal flaws, particularly in the case of demurrage charges.
    *  The court affirmed the Commercial Court's decision to set aside the Award regarding the additional claims and breach of contract but rejected the Commercial Court's power to modify the Award.
  *  **Interpretation of Law:**
    *  The court interpreted Section 34 of the Act of 1996 and its amendments to emphasize the limited scope of judicial interference in arbitration proceedings.
    *  The court interpreted the relevant provisions of the Act of 1872 to clarify the principles of compensation for breach of contract.
    *  The court analyzed the arbitration clause in the contract and the precedents related to the interpretation of contractual terms.
  *  **Application of Law:**
    *  The court applied the principles of public policy, breach of contract, and interpretation of contractual terms to the specific facts of the case.
    *  The court analyzed the arguments presented by both parties in light of the applicable legal provisions and precedents.

## 6. Judgment

  *  **Final Decision:** The court partly allowed the appeal filed by Univabs and dismissed the appeal filed by the Union.
  *  **Relief Granted:**  The court did not award damages or make specific findings on the merits of the additional claims.
  *  **Orders:** The court directed that Univabs could re-initiate arbitration proceedings to seek adjudication of the additional claims and compensation for the Union’s breach of contract.

  *  **Future Relevance:** The judgment provides guidance on the application of the principles of public policy and breach of contract in arbitration cases.
  *  **Broader Context:** The case highlights the complexities of contractual disputes involving government entities and the role of arbitration in resolving such disputes.
